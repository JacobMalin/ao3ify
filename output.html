							<p>
								Chapter 1
							</p>

							<p>
								Kip crawled toward the battlefield in the darkness, the mist pressing down,blotting out
								sound, scattering starlight. Though the adults shunned it and thechildren were forbidden
								to come here, he’d played on the open field ahundred times—during the day. Tonight, his
								purpose was grimmer.
							</p>

							<p>
								Reaching the top of the hill, Kip stood and hiked up his pants. The riverbehind him was
								hissing, or maybe that was the warriors beneath its surface,dead these sixteen years. He
								squared his shoulders, ignoring hisimagination. The mists made him seem suspended,
								outside of time. Buteven if there was no evidence of it, the sun was coming. By the time
								it did,he had to get to the far side of the battlefield. Farther than he’d ever
								gonesearching.
							</p>

							<p>
								Even Ramir wouldn’t come out here at night. Everyone knew Sundered
							</p>

							<p>
								Rock was haunted. But Ram didn’t have to feed his family; his motherdidn’t smoke her
								wages.
							</p>

							<p>
								Gripping his little belt knife tightly, Kip started walking. It wasn’t justthe unquiet
								dead that might pull him down to the evernight. A pack of giantjavelinas had been seen
								roaming the night, tusks cruel, hooves sharp. Theywere good eating if you had a
								matchlock, iron nerves, and good aim, butsince the Prisms’ War had wiped out all the
								town’s men, there weren’t manypeople who braved death for a little bacon. Rekton was
								already a shell ofwhat it had once been. The alcaldesa wasn’t eager for any of
								hertownspeople to throw their lives away. Besides, Kip didn’t have amatchlock.
							</p>

							<p>
								Nor were javelinas the only creatures that roamed the night. A mountainlion or a golden
								bear would also probably enjoy a well-marbled Kip.
							</p>

							<p>
								A low howl cut the mist and the darkness hundreds of paces deeper intothe battlefield.
								Kip froze. Oh, there were wolves too. How’d he forgetwolves?
							</p>

							<p>
								Another wolf answered, farther out. A haunting sound, the very voice ofthe wilderness.
								You couldn’t help but freeze when you heard it. It was thekind of beauty that made you
								shit your pants.
							</p>

							<p>
								Wetting his lips, Kip got moving. He had the distinct sensation of beingfollowed.
								Stalked. He looked over his shoulder. There was nothing there. Ofcourse. His mother
								always said he had too much imagination. Just walk,Kip. Places to be. Animals are more
								scared of you and all that. Besides, thatwas one of the tricks about a howl, it always
								sounded much closer than itreally was. Those wolves were probably leagues away.
							</p>

							<p>
								Before the Prisms’ War, this had been excellent farmland. Right next tothe Umber River,
								suitable for figs, grapes, pears, dewberries, asparagus—everything grew here. And it had
								been sixteen years since the final battle—ayear before Kip was even born. But the plain
								was still torn and scarred. Afew burnt timbers of old homes and barns poked out of the
								dirt. Deepfurrows and craters remained from cannon shells. Filled now with swirlingmist,
								those craters looked like lakes, tunnels, traps. Bottomless.Unfathomable.
							</p>

							<p>
								Most of the magic used in the battle had dissolved sooner or later in theyears of sun
								exposure, but here and there broken green luxin spears stillglittered. Shards of solid
								yellow underfoot would cut through the toughestshoe leather.
							</p>

							<p>
								Scavengers had long since taken all the valuable arms, mail, and luxinfrom the
								battlefield, but as the seasons passed and rains fell, more mysteriessurfaced each year.
								That was what Kip was hoping for—and what he wasseeking was most visible in the first
								rays of dawn.
							</p>

							<p>
								The wolves stopped howling. Nothing was worse than hearing thatchilling sound, but at
								least with the sound he knew where they were.Now… Kip swallowed on the hard knot in his
								throat.
							</p>

							<p>
								As he walked in the valley of the shadow of two great unnatural hills—the remnant of two
								of the great funeral pyres where tens of thousands hadburned—Kip saw something in the
								mist. His heart leapt into his throat. Thecurve of a mail cowl. A glint of eyes
								searching the darkness.
							</p>

							<p>
								Then it was swallowed up in the roiling mists.A ghost. Dear Orholam. Some spirit keeping
								watch at its grave.
							</p>

							<p>
								Look on the bright side. Maybe wolves are scared of ghosts.Kip realized he’d stopped
								walking, peering into the darkness. Move,fathead.
							</p>

							<p>
								He moved, keeping low. He might be big, but he prided himself onbeing light on his feet.
								He tore his eyes away from the hill—still no sign ofthe ghost or man or whatever it was.
								He had that feeling again that he wasbeing stalked. He looked back. Nothing.
							</p>

							<p>
								A quick click, like someone dropping a small stone. And something atthe corner of his
								eye. Kip shot a look up the hill. A click, a spark, thestriking of flint against steel.
							</p>

							<p>
								The mists illuminated for that briefest moment, Kip saw few details. Nota ghost—a
								soldier striking a flint, trying to light a slow-match. It caughtfire, casting a red
								glow on the soldier’s face, making his eyes seem to glow.He affixed the slow-match to
								the match-holder of his matchlock and spun,looking for targets in the darkness.
							</p>

							<p>
								His night vision must have been ruined by staring at the brief flame onhis match, now a
								smoldering red ember, because his eyes passed right overKip.
							</p>

							<p>
								The soldier turned again, sharply, paranoid. “The hell am I supposed tosee out here,
								anyway? Swivin’ wolves.”
							</p>

							<p>
								Very, very carefully, Kip started walking away. He had to get deeper intothe mist and
								darkness before the soldier’s night vision recovered, but if hemade noise, the man might
								fire blindly. Kip walked on his toes, silently, hisback itching, sure that a lead ball
								was going to tear through him at anymoment.
							</p>

							<p>
								But he made it. A hundred paces, more, and no one yelled. No shotcracked the night.
								Farther. Two hundred paces more, and he saw light off tohis left, a campfire. It had
								burned so low it was barely more than coals now.Kip tried not to look directly at it to
								save his vision. There was no tent, nobedrolls nearby, just the fire.
							</p>

							<p>
								Kip tried Master Danavis’s trick for seeing in darkness. He let his focusrelax and tried
								to view things from the periphery of his vision. Nothing butan irregularity, perhaps. He
								moved closer.
							</p>

							<p>
								Two men lay on the cold ground. One was a soldier. Kip had seen hismother unconscious
								plenty of times; he knew instantly this man wasn’tpassed out. He was sprawled
								unnaturally, there were no blankets, and hismouth hung open, slack-jawed, eyes staring
								unblinking at the night. Next tothe dead soldier lay another man, bound in chains but
								alive. He lay on hisside, hands manacled behind his back, a black bag over his head
								andcinched tight around his neck.
							</p>

							<p>
								The prisoner was alive, trembling. No, weeping. Kip looked around;there was no one else
								in sight.“Why don’t you just finish it, damn you?” the prisoner said.Kip froze. He
								thought he’d approached silently.“Coward,” the prisoner said. “Just following your
								orders, I suppose?
							</p>

							<p>
								Orholam will smite you for what you’re about to do to that little town.”
							</p>

							<p>
								Kip had no idea what the man was talking about.Apparently his silence spoke for
								him.“You’re not one of them.” A note of hope entered the prisoner’s voice.“Please, help
								me!”
							</p>

							<p>
								Kip stepped forward. The man was suffering. Then he stopped. Lookedat the dead soldier.
								The front of the soldier’s shirt was soaked with blood.Had this prisoner killed him?
								How?“Please, leave me chained if you must. But please, I don’t want to die indarkness.”
							</p>

							<p>
								Kip stayed back, though it felt cruel. “You killed him?”“I’m supposed to be executed at
								first light. I got away. He chased medown and got the bag over my head before he died.
								If dawn’s close, hisreplacement is coming anytime now.”
							</p>

							<p>
								Kip still wasn’t putting it together. No one in Rekton trusted the soldierswho came
								through, and the alcaldesa had told the town’s young people togive any soldiers a wide
								berth for a while—apparently the new satrapGaradul had declared himself free of the
								Chromeria’s control. Now he wasKing Garadul, he said, but he wanted the usual levies
								from the town’syoung people. The alcaldesa had told his representative that if he wasn’t
								thesatrap anymore, he didn’t have the right to raise levies. King or satrap,Garadul
								couldn’t be happy with that, but Rekton was too small to botherwith. Still, it would be
								wise to avoid his soldiers until this all blew over.
							</p>

							<p>
								On the other hand, just because Rekton wasn’t getting along with thesatrap right now
								didn’t make this man Kip’s friend.“So you are a criminal?” Kip asked.“Of six shades to
								Sun Day,” the man said. The hope leaked out of hisvoice. “Look, boy—you are a child,
								aren’t you? You sound like one. I’mgoing to die today. I can’t get away. Truth to tell,
								I don’t want to. I’ve runenough. This time, I fight.”“I don’t understand.”“You will.
								Take off my hood.”Though some vague doubt nagged Kip, he untied the half-knot aroundthe
								man’s neck and pulled off the hood.
							</p>

							<p>
								At first, Kip had no idea what the prisoner was talking about. The mansat up, arms still
								bound behind his back. He was perhaps thirty years old,Tyrean like Kip but with a
								lighter complexion, his hair wavy rather thankinky, his limbs thin and muscular. Then
								Kip saw his eyes.
							</p>

							<p>
								Men and women who could harness light and make luxin—drafters—always had unusual eyes. A
								little residue of whatever color they draftedended up in their eyes. Over the course of
								their life, it would stain the entireiris red, or blue, or whatever their color was. The
								prisoner was a greendrafter—or had been. Instead of the green being bound in a halo
								within theiris, it was shattered like crockery smashed to the floor. Little
								greenfragments glowed even in the whites of his eyes. Kip gasped and
								shrankback.“Please!” the man said. “Please, the madness isn’t on me. I won’t
								hurtyou.”“You’re a color wight.”“And now you know why I ran away from the Chromeria,”
								the mansaid.
							</p>

							<p>
								Because the Chromeria put down color wights like a farmer put down abeloved, rabid dog.
							</p>

							<p>
								Kip was on the verge of bolting, but the man wasn’t making anythreatening moves. And
								besides, it was still dark. Even color wights neededlight to draft. The mist did seem
								lighter, though, gray beginning to touch thehorizon. It was crazy to talk to a madman,
								but maybe it wasn’t too crazy. Atleast until dawn.
							</p>

							<p>
								The color wight was looking at Kip oddly. “Blue eyes.” He laughed.Kip scowled. He hated
								his blue eyes. It was one thing when a foreignerlike Master Danavis had blue eyes. They
								looked fine on him. Kip lookedfreakish.“What’s your name?” the color wight asked.Kip
								swallowed, thinking he should probably run away.“Oh, for Orholam’s sake, you think I’m
								going to hex you with yourname? How ignorant is this backwater? That isn’t how
								chromaturgy works—”“Kip.”The color wight grinned. “Kip. Well, Kip, have you ever
								wondered whyyou were stuck in such a small life? Have you ever gotten the feeling,
								Kip,that you’re special?”
							</p>

							<p>
								Kip said nothing. Yes, and yes.“Do you know why you feel destined for something
								greater?”“Why?” Kip asked, quiet, hopeful.“Because you’re an arrogant little shit.” The
								color wight laughed.Kip shouldn’t have been taken off guard. His mother had said worse.
							</p>

							<p>
								Still, it took him a moment. A small failure. “Burn in hell, coward,” he said.“You’re
								not even good at running away. Caught by ironfoot soldiers.”
							</p>

							<p>
								The color wight laughed louder. “Oh, they didn’t catch me. Theyrecruited me.”
							</p>

							<p>
								Who would recruit madmen to join them? “They didn’t know you werea—”“Oh, they
								knew.”Dread like a weight dropped into Kip’s stomach. “You said somethingabout my town.
								Before. What are they planning to do?”“You know, Orholam’s got a sense of humor. Never
								realized that tillnow. Orphan, aren’t you?”“No. I’ve got a mother,” Kip said. He
								instantly regretted giving the colorwight even that much.“Would you believe me if I told
								you there’s a prophecy about you?”“It wasn’t funny the first time,” Kip said. “What’s
								going to happen tomy town?” Dawn was coming, and Kip wasn’t going to stick around.
								Notonly would the guard’s replacement come then, but Kip had no idea whatthe wight would
								do once he had light.“You know,” the wight said, “you’re the reason I’m here. Not here
								here.
							</p>

							<p>
								Not like ‘Why do I exist?’ Not in Tyrea. In chains, I mean.”“What?” Kip asked.“There’s
								power in madness, Kip. Of course…” He trailed off, laughed ata private thought.
								Recovered. “Look, that soldier has a key in his breastpocket. I couldn’t get it out, not
								with—” He shook his hands, bound andmanacled behind his back.“And I would help you why?”
								Kip asked.“For a few straight answers before dawn.”Crazy, and cunning. Perfect. “Give me
								one first,” Kip said.“Shoot.”“What’s the plan for Rekton?”“Fire.”“What?” Kip
								asked.“Sorry, you said one answer.”“That was no answer!”“They’re going to wipe out your
								village. Make an example so no oneelse defies King Garadul. Other villages defied the
								king too, of course. Hisrebellion against the Chromeria isn’t popular everywhere. For
								every townburning to take vengeance on the Prism, there’s another that wants nothingto
								do with war. Your village was chosen specially. Anyway, I had a littlespasm of
								conscience and objected. Words were exchanged. I punched mysuperior. Not totally my
								fault. They know us greens don’t do rules andhierarchy. Especially not once we’ve broken
								the halo.” The color wightshrugged. “There, straight. I think that deserves the key,
								don’t you?”
							</p>

							<p>
								It was too much information to soak up at once—broken the halo?—butit was a straight
								answer. Kip walked over to the dead man. His skin waspallid in the rising light. Pull it
								together, Kip. Ask whatever you need toask.
							</p>

							<p>
								Kip could tell that dawn was coming. Eerie shapes were emerging fromthe night. The great
								twin looming masses of Sundered Rock itself werevisible mostly as a place where stars
								were blotted out of the sky.
							</p>

							<p>
								What do I need to ask?He was hesitating, not wanting to touch the dead man. He knelt.
								“Whymy town?” He poked through the dead man’s pocket, careful not to touchskin. It was
								there, two keys.“They think you have something that belongs to the king. I don’t
								knowwhat. I only picked up that much by eavesdropping.”“What would Rekton have that the
								king wants?” Kip asked.“Not Rekton you. You you.”It took Kip a second. He touched his
								own chest. “Me? Me personally? Idon’t even own anything!”
							</p>

							<p>
								The color wight gave a crazy grin, but Kip thought it was a pretense.“Tragic mistake,
								then. Their mistake, your tragedy.”“What, you think I’m lying?!” Kip asked. “You think
								I’d be out herescavenging luxin if I had any other choice?”“I don’t really care one way
								or the other. You going to bring that keyover here, or do I need to ask real nice?”
							</p>

							<p>
								It was a mistake to bring the keys over. Kip knew it. The color wightwasn’t stable. He
								was dangerous. He’d admitted as much. But he had kepthis word. How could Kip do less?
							</p>

							<p>
								Kip unlocked the man’s manacles, and then the padlock on the chains.
							</p>

							<p>
								He backed away carefully, as one would from a wild animal. The colorwight pretended not
								to notice, simply rubbing his arms and stretching backand forth. He moved over to the
								guard and poked through his pockets again.His hand emerged with a pair of green
								spectacles with one cracked lens.“You could come with me,” Kip said. “If what you said
								is true—”“How close do you think I’d get to your town before someone camerunning with a
								musket? Besides, once the sun comes up… I’m ready for itto be done.” The color wight
								took a deep breath, staring at the horizon.“Tell me, Kip, if you’ve done bad things your
								whole life, but you die doingsomething good, do you think that makes up for all the
								bad?”“No,” Kip said, honestly, before he could stop himself.“Me neither.”“But it’s
								better than nothing,” Kip said. “Orholam is merciful.”“Wonder if you’ll say that after
								they’re done with your village.”There were other questions Kip wanted to ask, but
								everything hadhappened in such a rush that he couldn’t put his thoughts together.
							</p>

							<p>
								In the rising light Kip saw what had been hidden in the fog and thedarkness. Hundreds of
								tents were laid out in military precision. Soldiers.Lots of soldiers. And even as Kip
								stood, not two hundred paces from thenearest tent, the plain began winking. Glimmers
								sparkled as broken luxingleamed, like stars scattered on the ground, answering their
								brethren in thesky.
							</p>

							<p>
								It was what Kip had come for. Usually when a drafter released luxin, itsimply dissolved,
								no matter what color it was. But in battle, there had beenso much chaos, so many
								drafters, some sealed magic had been buried andprotected from the sunlight that would
								break it down. The recent rain haduncovered more.
							</p>

							<p>
								But Kip’s eyes were pulled from the winking luxin by four soldiers anda man with a stark
								red cloak and red spectacles walking toward them fromthe camp.“My name is Gaspar, by the
								by. Gaspar Elos.” The color wight didn’tlook at Kip.“What?”“I’m not just some drafter.
								My father loved me. I had plans. A girl. Alife.”“I don’t—”“You will.” The color wight
								put the green spectacles on; they fitperfectly, tight to his face, lenses sweeping to
								either side so that whereverhe looked, he would be looking through a green filter. “Now
								get out ofhere.”
							</p>

							<p>
								As the sun touched the horizon, Gaspar sighed. It was as if Kip hadceased to exist. It
								was like watching his mother take that first deep breath ofhaze. Between the sparkling
								spars of darker green, the whites of Gaspar’seyes swirled like droplets of green blood
								hitting water, first dispersing, thenstaining the whole. The emerald green of luxin
								ballooned through his eyes,thickened until it was solid, and then spread. Through his
								cheeks, up to hishairline, then down his neck, standing out starkly when it finally
								filled hislighter fingernails as if they’d been painted in radiant jade.
							</p>

							<p>
								Gaspar started laughing. It was a low, unreasoning cackle, unrelenting.
							</p>

							<p>
								Mad. Not a pretense this time.
							</p>

							<p>
								Kip ran.He reached the funerary hill where the sentry had been, taking care tostay on
								the far side from the army. He had to get to Master Danavis. MasterDanavis always knew
								what to do.
							</p>

							<p>
								There was no sentry on the hill now. Kip turned around in time to see
							</p>

							<p>
								Gaspar change, transform. Green luxin spilled out of his hands onto hisbody, covering
								every part of him like a shell, like an enormous suit ofarmor. Kip couldn’t see the
								soldiers or the red drafter approaching Gaspar,but he did see a fireball the size of his
								head streak toward the color wight,hit his chest, and burst apart, throwing flames
								everywhere.
							</p>

							<p>
								Gaspar rammed through it, flaming red luxin sticking to his green armor.
							</p>

							<p>
								He was magnificent, terrible, powerful. He ran toward the soldiers,screaming defiance,
								and disappeared from Kip’s view.
							</p>

							<p>
								Kip fled, the vermilion sun setting fire to the mists.
							</p>

							<p>
								Chapter 2
							</p>

							<p>
								Gavin Guile sleepily eyed the papers that slid under his door and wonderedwhat Karris
								was punishing him for this time. His rooms occupied half of thetop floor of the
								Chromeria, but the panoramic windows were blackened sothat if he slept at all, he could
								sleep in. The seal on the letter pulsed sogently that Gavin couldn’t tell what color had
								been drafted into it. Hepropped himself up in bed so he could get a better look and
								dilated hispupils to gather as much light as possible.
							</p>

							<p>
								Superviolet. Oh, sonuva—On every side, the floor-to-ceiling blackened windows dropped
								into thefloor, bathing the room in full-spectrum light as the morning sun wasrevealed,
								climbing the horizon over the dual islands. With his eyes dilatedso far, magic flooded
								Gavin. It was too much to hold.
							</p>

							<p>
								Light exploded from him in every direction, passing through him insuccessive waves from
								superviolet down. The sub-red was last, rushingthrough his skin like a wave of flame. He
								jumped out of bed, sweatinginstantly. But with all the windows open, cold summer morning
								windsblasted through his chambers, chilling him. He yelped, hopping back intobed.
							</p>

							<p>
								His yelp must have been loud enough for Karris to hear it and know thather rude
								awakening had been successful, because he heard her unmistakablelaugh. She wasn’t a
								superviolet, so she must have had a friend help her withher little prank. A quick shot
								of superviolet luxin at the room’s controlsthrew the windows closed and set the filters
								to half. Gavin extended a handto blast his door open, then stopped. He wasn’t going to
								give Karris thesatisfaction. Her assignment to be the White’s fetch-and-carry girl
								hadostensibly been intended to teach her humility and gravitas. So far thatmuch had been
								a spectacular failure, though the White always played adeeper game. Still, Gavin
								couldn’t help grinning as he rose and swept thefolded papers Karris had tucked under the
								door into his hand.
							</p>

							<p>
								He walked to his door. On a small service table just outside, he found hisbreakfast on a
								platter. It was the same every morning: two squat bricks ofbread and a pale wine in a
								clear glass cup. The bread was made of wheat,barley, beans, lentils, millet, and spelt,
								unleavened. A man could live onthat bread. In fact, a man was living on that bread. Just
								not Gavin. Indeed,the sight of it made his stomach turn. He could order a different
								breakfast,of course, but he never did.
							</p>

							<p>
								He brought it inside, setting the papers on the table next to the bread.
							</p>

							<p>
								One was odd, a plain note that didn’t look like the White’s personalstationery, nor any
								official hard white stationery the Chromeria used. Heturned it over. The Chromeria’s
								message office had marked it as beingreceived from “ST, Rekton”: Satrapy of Tyrea, town
								of Rekton. It soundedfamiliar, maybe one of those towns near Sundered Rock? But then,
								therehad once been so many towns there. Probably someone begging anaudience, though
								those letters were supposed to be screened out and dealtwith separately.
							</p>

							<p>
								Still, first things first. He tore open each loaf, checking that nothing hadbeen
								concealed inside it. Satisfied, he took out a bottle of the blue dye hekept in a drawer
								and dribbled a bit into the wine. He swirled the wine tomix it, and held the glass up
								against the granite blue sky of a painting hekept on the wall as his reference.
							</p>

							<p>
								He’d done it perfectly, of course. He’d been doing this for almost sixthousand mornings
								now. Almost sixteen years. A long time for a man onlythirty-three years old. He poured
								the wine over the broken halves of thebread, staining it blue—and harmless. Once a week,
								Gavin would prepare ablue cheese or blue fruit, but it took more time.
							</p>

							<p>
								He picked up the note from Tyrea.“I’m dying, Gavin. It’s time you meet your son
								Kip.—Lina”Son? I don’t have a—Suddenly his throat clamped down, and his chest felt like
								his heart wasseizing up, no matter that the chirurgeons said it wasn’t. Just relax,
								theysaid. Young and strong as a warhorse, they said. They didn’t say, Grow apair. You’ve
								got lots of friends, your enemies fear you, and you have norivals. You’re the Prism.
								What are you afraid of? No one had talked to himthat way in years. Sometimes he wished
								they would.
							</p>

							<p>
								Orholam, the note hadn’t even been sealed.Gavin walked out onto his glass balcony,
								subconsciously checking hisdrafting as he did every morning. He stared at his hand,
								splitting sunlightinto its component colors as only he could do, filling each finger in
								turnwith a color, from below the visible spectrum to above it: sub-red, red,orange,
								yellow, green, blue, superviolet. Had he felt a hitch there when hedrafted blue? He
								double-checked it, glancing briefly toward the sun.
							</p>

							<p>
								No, it was still easy to split light, still flawless. He released the luxin,each color
								sliding out and dissipating like smoke from beneath hisfingernails, releasing the
								familiar bouquet of resinous scents.
							</p>

							<p>
								He turned his face to the sun, its warmth like a mother’s caress. Gavinopened his eyes
								and sucked in a warm, soothing red. In and out, in timewith his labored breaths, willing
								them to slow. Then he let the red go andtook in a deep icy blue. It felt like it was
								freezing his eyes. As ever, the bluebrought clarity, peace, order. But not a plan, not
								with so little information.He let go of the colors. He was still fine. He still had at
								least five of hisseven years left. Plenty of time. Five years, five great purposes.
							</p>

							<p>
								Well, maybe not five great purposes.Still, of his predecessors in the last four hundred
								years, aside from thosewho’d been assassinated or died of other causes, the rest had
								served forexactly seven, fourteen, or twenty-one years after becoming Prism. Gavinhad
								made it past fourteen. So, plenty of time. No reason to think he’d be theexception. Not
								many, anyway.
							</p>

							<p>
								He picked up the second note. Cracking the White’s seal—the old cronesealed everything,
								though she shared the other half of this floor and Karrishand-delivered her messages.
								But everything had to be in its proper place,properly done. There was no mistaking that
								she’d risen from Blue.
							</p>

							<p>
								The White’s note read, “Unless you would prefer to greet the studentsarriving late this
								morning, my dear Lord Prism, please attend me on theroof.”
							</p>

							<p>
								Looking beyond the Chromeria’s buildings and the city, Gavin studiedthe merchant ships
								in the bay cupped in the lee of Big Jasper Island. Aragged-looking Atashian sloop was
								maneuvering in to dock directly at apier.
							</p>

							<p>
								Greeting new students. Unbelievable. It wasn’t that he was too good togreet new
								students—well, actually, it was that. He, the White, and theSpectrum were supposed to
								balance each other. But though the Spectrumfeared him the most, the reality was that the
								crone got her way more oftenthan Gavin and the seven Colors combined. This morning she
								had to bewanting to experiment on him again, and if he wanted to avoid somethingmore
								onerous like teaching he’d better get to the top of the tower.
							</p>

							<p>
								Gavin drafted his red hair into a tight ponytail and dressed in the clotheshis room
								slave had laid out for him: an ivory shirt and a well-cut pair ofblack wool pants with
								an oversize gem-studded belt, boots with silverwork,and a black cloak with harsh old
								Ilytian runic designs embroidered in silverthread. The Prism belonged to all the
								satrapies, so Gavin did his best tohonor the traditions of every land—even one that was
								mainly pirates andheretics.
							</p>

							<p>
								He hesitated a moment, then pulled open a drawer and drew out hisbrace of Ilytian
								pistols. They were, typical for Ilytian work, the mostadvanced design Gavin had ever
								seen. The firing mechanism was far morereliable than a wheellock—they were calling it a
								flintlock. Each pistol had along blade beneath the barrel, and even a belt-flange so
								that when he tuckedthem into his belt behind his back they were held securely and at an
								angleso he didn’t skewer himself when he sat. The Ilytians thought of everything.
							</p>

							<p>
								And, of course, the pistols made the White’s Blackguards nervous.
							</p>

							<p>
								Gavin grinned.
							</p>

							<p>
								When he turned for the door and saw the painting again, his grindropped.
							</p>

							<p>
								He walked back to the table with the blue bread. Grabbing one use-smoothened edge of the
								painting, he pulled. It swung open silently,revealing a narrow chute.
							</p>

							<p>
								Nothing menacing about the chute. Too small for a man to climb up,even if he overcame
								everything else. It might have been a laundry chute.Yet to Gavin it looked like the
								mouth of hell, the evernight itself openingwide for him. He tossed one of the bricks of
								bread into it, then waited.There was a thunk as the hard bread hit the first lock, a
								small hiss as itopened, then closed, then a smaller thunk as it hit the next lock, and a
								fewmoments later one last thunk. Each of the locks was still working.Everything was
								normal. Safe. There had been mistakes over the years, butno one had to die this time. No
								need for paranoia. He nearly snarled as heslammed the painting closed.
							</p>

							<p>
								Chapter 3
							</p>

							<p>
								Three thunks. Three hisses. Three gates between him and freedom. Thechute spat a torn
								brick of bread at the prisoner’s face. He caught it, almostwithout looking. He knew it
								was blue, the still blue of a deep lake in earlymorning, when night still hoards the sky
								and the air dares not caress thewater’s skin. Unadulterated by any other color, drafting
								that blue wasdifficult. Worse, drafting it made the prisoner feel bored, passionless,
								atpeace, in harmony with even this place. And he needed the fire of hatredtoday. Today,
								he would escape.
							</p>

							<p>
								After all his years here, sometimes he couldn’t even see the color, likehe had awoken to
								a world painted in grays. The first year had been theworst. His eyes, so accustomed to
								nuance, so adept at parsing everyspectrum of light, had begun deceiving him. He’d
								hallucinated colors. Hetried to draft those colors into the tools to break this prison.
								But imaginationwasn’t enough to make magic, one needed light. Real light. He’d been
								aPrism, so any color would do, from those above violet to the ones belowred. He’d
								gathered the very heat from his own body, soaked his eyes inthose sub-reds, and flung
								that against the tedious blue walls.
							</p>

							<p>
								Of course, the walls were hardened against such pathetic amounts ofheat. He’d drafted a
								blue dagger and sawn at his wrist. Where the blooddripped onto the stone floor, it was
								immediately leached of color. The nexttime, he’d cupped his own blood in his hands to
								try to draft red, but hecouldn’t get enough color given that the only light in the cell
								was blue.Bleeding onto the bread hadn’t worked either. Its natural brown was
								alwaysstained blue, so adding red only yielded a dark, purplish brown.
							</p>

							<p>
								Undraftable. Of course. His brother had thought of everything. But then, healways had.
							</p>

							<p>
								The prisoner sat next to the drain and began eating. The dungeon wasshaped like a
								flattened ball: the walls and ceiling a perfect sphere, the floorless steep but still
								sloping toward the middle. The walls were lit fromwithin, every surface emitting the
								same color light. The only shadow in thedungeon was the prisoner himself. There were
								only two holes: the chuteabove, which released his food and one steady rivulet of water
								that he hadto lick for his moisture, and the drain below for his waste.
							</p>

							<p>
								He had no utensils, no tools except his hands and his will, always hiswill. With his
								will, he could draft anything from the blue that he wanted,though it would dissolve as
								soon as his will released it, leaving only dustand a faint mineral-and-resin odor.
							</p>

							<p>
								But today was going to be the day his vengeance began, his first day offreedom. This
								attempt wouldn’t fail—he refused to even think of it as an“attempt”—and there was work
								to be done. Things had to be done in order.He couldn’t remember now if he had always
								been this way or if he’d soakedin blue for so long that the color had changed him
								fundamentally.
							</p>

							<p>
								He knelt next to the only feature of the cell that his brother hadn’tcreated. A single,
								shallow depression in the floor, a bowl. First he rubbedthe bowl with his bare hands,
								grinding the corrosive oils from his fingertipsinto the stone for as long as he dared.
								Scar tissue didn’t produce oil, so hehad to stop before he rubbed his fingers raw. He
								scraped two fingernailsalong the crease between his nose and face, two others between
								his ears andhead, gathering more oil. Anywhere he could collect oils from his body,
								hedid, and rubbed it into the bowl. Not that there was any discernible change,but over
								the years his bowl had become deep enough to cover his finger tothe second joint. His
								jailer had bound the color-leaching hellstones into thefloor in a grid. Whatever spread
								far enough to cross one of those lines lostall color almost instantly. But hellstone was
								terribly expensive. How deepdid they go?
							</p>

							<p>
								If the grid only extended a few thumbs into the stone, his raw fingersmight reach beyond
								it any day. Freedom wouldn’t be far behind. But if hisjailer had used enough hellstone
								that the crosshatching lines ran a foot deep,then he’d been rubbing his fingers raw for
								almost six thousand days fornothing. He’d die here. Someday, his brother would come
								down, see thelittle bowl—his only mark on the world—and laugh. With that laughterechoing
								in his ears, he felt a small spark of anger in his breast. He blew onthat spark, basked
								in its warmth. It was fire enough to help him move,enough to counter the soothing,
								debilitating blue down here.
							</p>

							<p>
								Finished, he urinated into the bowl. And watched.For a moment, filtered through the
								yellow of his urine, the cursed bluelight was sliced with green. His breath caught. Time
								stretched as the greenstayed green… stayed green. By Orholam, he’d done it. He’d gone
								deepenough. He’d broken through the hellstone!
							</p>

							<p>
								And then the green disappeared. In exactly the same two seconds it tookevery day. He
								screamed in frustration, but even his frustration was weak,his scream more to assure
								himself he could still hear than real fury.
							</p>

							<p>
								The next part still drove him crazy. He knelt by the depression. Hisbrother had turned
								him into an animal. A dog, playing with his own shit.But that emotion was too old, mined
								too many times to give him any realwarmth. Six thousand days on, he was too debased to
								resent hisdebasement. Putting both hands into his urine, he scrubbed it around thebowl
								as he had scrubbed his oils. Even leached of all color, urine was stillurine. It should
								still be acidic. It should corrode the hellstone faster than theskin oils alone would.
							</p>

							<p>
								Or the urine might neutralize the oils. He might be pushing the day ofhis escape further
								and further away. He had no idea. That was what madehim crazy, not immersing his fingers
								in warm urine. Not anymore.
							</p>

							<p>
								He scooped the urine out of the bowl and dried it with a wad of bluerags: his clothes,
								his pillow, now stinking of urine. Stinking of urine for solong that the stench didn’t
								offend him anymore. It didn’t matter. Whatmattered was that the bowl had to be dry by
								tomorrow so he could tryagain.
							</p>

							<p>
								Another day, another failure. Tomorrow, he would try sub-red again. Ithad been a while.
								He’d recovered enough from his last attempt. He shouldbe strong enough for it. If
								nothing else, his brother had taught him howstrong he really was. And maybe that was
								what made him hate Gavin morethan anything. But it was a hatred as cold as his cell.
							</p>

							<p>
								Chapter 4
							</p>

							<p>
								In the early morning chill, Kip jogged across the town square as fast as hisungainly
								fifteen-year-old frame would allow. He caught his shoe on acobblestone and pitched
								headlong through Master Danavis’s back gate.“Are you okay, boy?” Master Danavis asked
								from his seat at his workbench, his dark eyebrows rising high above cornflower blue
								eyes, the iriseshalf filled with the stark ruby red that marked him a drafter. Master
								Danaviswas in his early forties, beardless and wiry, wearing thick wool work pantsand a
								thin shirt that left lean, muscled arms uncovered despite the coldmorning. A pair of red
								spectacles sat low on his nose.“Ow, ow.” Kip looked at his skinned palms. His knees were
								burning too.“No, no I’m not.” He hitched his pants up, wincing as his scraped
								palmsrubbed on the heavy, once-black linen.“Good, good, because—ah, here. Tell me, are
								these the same?” Master
							</p>

							<p>
								Danavis put out both of his hands. Both were bright red, filled with luxinfrom the elbow
								to his fingers. He turned his arm over so that his light kopi-and-cream-colored skin
								wouldn’t interfere as much with Kip’s examination.Like Kip, Master Danavis was a
								half-breed—though Kip had never heardanyone give the drafter any trouble for that,
								unlike him. In the dyer’s case,he was half Blood Forester, his face marked with a few
								strange dots theycalled freckles, and a hint of red in his otherwise normal dark hair.
								But atleast his lighter than normal skin made what he was asking Kip easy.
							</p>

							<p>
								Kip pointed to a region from the dyer’s forearm to his elbow. “This redchanges color
								here, and this one’s a bit brighter. Can I, uh, talk to you, sir?”
							</p>

							<p>
								Master Danavis flicked both hands down with disgust and ruby luxinsplashed onto ground
								already splattered a hundred shades of red. The gooeyluxin crumpled and dissolved. Most
								afternoons, Kip came to sweep up theremnants—red luxin was flammable even when it was
								dust.“Superchromats! It’s one thing for my daughter to be one, but thealcaldesa’s
								husband? And you? Two men in one town? Wait, what’s wrong,Kip?”“Sir, there’s ah…” Kip
								hesitated. Not only was the battlefield forbidden,but Master Danavis had once said that
								he thought scavenging there was nodifferent than grave robbing. “Have you heard from
								Liv, sir?” Coward.Three years ago, Liv Danavis had left to be trained at the Chromeria
								likeher father before her. They’d only been able to afford for her to come homeat the
								harvest break her first year.“Come here, boy. Show me those hands.” Master Danavis
								grabbed aclean rag and blotted up the blood, dislodging the dirt with firm strokes.Then
								he uncorked a jug and held the rag over its mouth. He rubbed thebrandy-soaked rag over
								Kip’s palms.
							</p>

							<p>
								Kip gasped.“Don’t be a baby,” Master Danavis said. Even though Kip had done oddjobs for
								the dyer for as long as he could remember, he was still scared ofhim sometimes. “Knees.”
							</p>

							<p>
								Grimacing, Kip pulled up one pant leg and propped his foot on a workbench. Liv was two
								years older than Kip—almost seventeen now. Not eventhe lack of men in the village had
								made her look at Kip as anything morethan a child, of course, but she had always been
								nice to him. A pretty girlbeing nice and only accidentally patronizing was pretty much
								the best Kipcould hope for.“Let’s just say that not all sharks and sea demons are in the
								sea.
							</p>

							<p>
								Chromeria’s a tough place for a Tyrean since the war.”“So you think she might come
								home?”“Kip,” Master Danavis said, “is your mother in trouble again?”Master Danavis had
								refused to apprentice Kip as a dyer, saying therewasn’t enough work in little Rekton to
								give Kip a future, and insisting heonly was a halfway decent dyer himself because he
								could draft. He’d beensomething else before the Prisms’ War, obviously, because he’d
								beenChromeria trained. That wasn’t cheap, and most drafters were sworn toservice to pay
								the expense. So Master Danavis’s own master must havebeen killed during the war, leaving
								him adrift. But few adults talked aboutthose days. Tyrea had lost and everything had
								gotten bad, that’s all Kip orthe other children knew.
							</p>

							<p>
								Still, Master Danavis paid Kip to do odd jobs and, like half the mothersin town, would
								give him a meal anytime he wandered by. Even better, healways let Kip eat the cakes the
								women in town sent, trying to attract thehandsome bachelor’s attention.“Sir, there’s an
								army on the other side of the river. They’re coming towipe out the town to make an
								example of us for defying King Garadul.”
							</p>

							<p>
								Master Danavis started to say something, then saw that Kip was serious.
							</p>

							<p>
								He said nothing for a moment, then his whole demeanor changed.
							</p>

							<p>
								He started asking Kip questions rapid-fire: where were they exactly,when was he there,
								how did he know they were going to wipe out the town,what had the tents looked like, how
								many tents had he counted, were thereany drafters? Kip’s answers were unbelievable even
								to his own ears, butMaster Danavis accepted it all.“He said King Garadul is recruiting
								color wights? You’re certain?”“Yessir.”Master Danavis rubbed his upper lip with thumb
								and forefinger, like aman would smooth his mustache, though he was clean-shaven. He
								strode toa chest, opened it, and grabbed a purse out. “Kip, your friends are fishingthis
								morning at Green Bridge. You need to get out there and warn them. Theking’s men will
								seize that bridge. If you don’t warn them, your friends willbe killed or taken for
								slaves. I’ll warn everyone here in town. Worse comesto worst, use that money to get to
								the Chromeria. Liv will help you.”“But—but, my mother! Where—”“Kip, I’ll do my best to
								save her and everyone here. No one else is goingto save your friends. You want Isabel
								taken as a slave? You know whathappens, right?”
							</p>

							<p>
								Kip blanched. Isa was still a tomboy, but it hadn’t escaped him that shewas turning into
								a beautiful woman. She wasn’t always very nice to him,but the thought of someone hurting
								her filled him with rage. “Yes, sir.” Kipturned to go, hesitated. “Sir, what’s a
								superchromat?”“A pain in my ass. Now go!”
							</p>

							<p>
								Chapter 5
							</p>

							<p>
								This was not going to be pretty. The note, the you-have-a-son note, hadn’tbeen sealed.
								Gavin could pretty much guarantee that the White’s peopleread all of his correspondence.
								But Karris had laughed after giving him thenote, which meant she hadn’t. So she didn’t
								know. Yet. But she’d gone toreport to the White. Where Gavin was expected.
							</p>

							<p>
								He rolled his shoulders and stretched his neck to one side and then theother, each
								giving a satisfying little pop, then started walking. HisBlackguards fell in step behind
								him, each carrying a wheellock musket andwearing an ataghan or other weapon. He climbed
								the stairs to the open roofbalcony of the Chromeria. As always, he noticed Karris first.
								She was short,with a naturally curvy figure now carved into too-hard planes and veins
								byyears of strenuous training. Her hair was long and straight and platinumblonde today.
								Yesterday it had been pink. Gavin liked it blonde. Blondeusually meant she was in a good
								mood. Her hair color changes werenothing magical. She just liked to change frequently.
								Or maybe she figuredshe stood out so much that she might as well not even try to blend
								in.
							</p>

							<p>
								Like the other Blackguards protecting the White, Karris wore fine blacktrousers and
								blouse, cut for fighting and plain except for the embroidery ofher rank on the shoulder
								and at the neck in gold thread. Like the others, shecarried a slim black ataghan—a
								slightly forward-curving sword with asingle cutting edge for most of its length—and
								rather than a shield, a metalparrying stick with a punch dagger in the middle. Like the
								others, she wasextensively trained in the use of both, and a number of other
								weapons.Unlike the others, her skin wasn’t the deep black of a Parian or an Ilytian.
							</p>

							<p>
								Nor was her mood dark, apparently. There was a mischievous little twistto her lips.
								Gavin raised a brow at her, pretending to be mildly peeved abouther earlier prank with
								the shades in his room, and came to stand before theWhite.
							</p>

							<p>
								Orea Pullawr was a shrunken old woman who was taking more andmore to the wheeled chair
								she sat in now. Her Blackguards made sure thatevery guard rotation had at least one
								burly man in case she needed to becarried up or down stairs. But despite her physical
								infirmity, Orea Pullawrhadn’t needed to fend off a challenger for the white robe for
								more than adecade. Most people couldn’t even remember her real name; she simplywas the
								White.“Are you ready?” she asked. Even after all these years, she still hadtrouble
								accepting that this wasn’t hard for him.“I’ll manage.”“You always do,” she said. Her
								eyes were clear and gray except for twobroad arcs of color surrounding each iris, blue
								on top and green below. TheWhite was a blue/green bichrome, but those arcs of color were
								washed outin her eyes, desaturated now because she hadn’t drafted in so long. But
								eacharc was as thick as possible, extending from the pupil out to the very edgeof each
								iris. If she ever drafted again, she’d break the halo: the color wouldbreak through into
								the whites of each eye, and that would be the end of her.That was why she didn’t wear
								colored spectacles. Unlike other retireddrafters, she didn’t even continue the pretense
								of carrying around herunused spectacles to remind everyone of what she once was. Orea
								Pullawrwas the White, and it was enough.
							</p>

							<p>
								Gavin headed to the dais. Above it, mounted on arcing tracks so it couldbe adjusted for
								any time of day or month of the year, a great polishedcrystal hung. He didn’t need it.
								Never had, but it seemed to make everyonemore comfortable to think he required some
								crutch to handle so much light.He never got lightsick either. Life just wasn’t fair.
								“Any special requests?”he asked.
							</p>

							<p>
								How exactly the Prism felt the imbalances in the world’s magic was stilla mystery.
								Shrouded in religious hokum about the Prism being connectedstraight to Orholam and
								therefore all the satrapies, the subject had not evenbeen studied before Gavin became
								the Prism. Even the White had beenquite nearly fearful when she asked about it, and she
								was as brassy awoman as Gavin had ever met.
							</p>

							<p>
								Not that they’d made much progress, but long ago he and the White hadstruck a bargain:
								she would study him intensely and he would cooperate,and in turn she would allow him to
								travel without Blackguards dogging hisevery step. It worked, mostly. Sometimes he
								couldn’t help but tease her,since it seemed they hadn’t learned anything in the sixteen
								years he’d beenthe Prism. Of course, when he pushed her too far, she’d bring him up
								hereand say she really needed to examine how the light moved through his skin.So he’d
								balance. In the open air. In the winter. Naked.
							</p>

							<p>
								Not pleasant. Gavin being Gavin, he’d learned pretty much exactlywhere the line was.
								Emperor of the Seven Satrapies indeed.“I’d like you to start allowing the Blackguard to
								do their jobs, Lord
							</p>

							<p>
								Prism.”“I meant about the balancing.”“They train their whole lives to serve us. They
								risk their lives. And youdisappear, every week. We agreed you could travel without them,
								but onlyduring emergencies.”
							</p>

							<p>
								Serve us? It’s a little more complicated than that.“I live dangerous,” Gavin said. They
								fought about this all the time.
							</p>

							<p>
								Doubtless the White figured that if she didn’t make a show here, he wouldpush for more
								freedom. Doubtless she was right. Gavin looked at the Whiteflatly. The White looked at
								Gavin flatly. The Blackguards were very, veryquiet.
							</p>

							<p>
								Is this how you would have handled them, brother? Or would you havesimply charmed them
								into submission? Everything in my life is aboutpower.“Nothing special today,” the White
								said. Gavin began.A Prism, at core, did two things no one else could do. First, Gavin
								couldsplit light into its component colors without external aids. A normal reddrafter
								could draft only an arc of red, some a wider arc, some a lesser arc. Inorder to draft,
								they had to be seeing red—red rocks, blood, a sunset, adesert, whatever. Or, as drafters
								had learned long ago, they could wear redspectacles, which filtered the sun’s white
								light to deliver only red. It gaveless power, but it was better than being utterly
								dependent on one’ssurroundings.
							</p>

							<p>
								The same limitations applied to every drafter: monochromes could draftonly one color;
								bichromes could draft two colors. Generally, it was colorsthat bordered each other, like
								red and orange, or yellow and green.
							</p>

							<p>
								Polychromes—those who controlled three or more colors—were the rarest,but even they had
								to draft from the colors they could see. Only the Prismnever needed spectacles. Only
								Gavin could split light within himself.
							</p>

							<p>
								That was convenient for Gavin, but it didn’t help anyone else. What didhelp was this:
								standing atop the Chromeria, light streaming through hiseyes, filling his skin with
								every color in the spectrum, bleeding out of everypore, he could feel the imbalances in
								magic in all the world.“To the southeast, like before,” Gavin said. “Deep in Tyrea,
								likely
							</p>

							<p>
								Kelfing, someone’s using sub-red, and lots of it.” Heat and fire usuallymeant war magic.
								It was the first place most non-drafting warlords orsatraps went when they wanted to
								kill people. No subtlety. The amount ofsub-red being used in Tyrea meant either they’d
								been having a quiet war, orthe new satrap Rask Garadul had set up his own school to
								train battledrafters. It wouldn’t be something his neighbors would be happy to learn.The
								Ruthgari governor who occupied Tyrea’s former capital Garristondefinitely wouldn’t be
								happy to learn it.
							</p>

							<p>
								In addition to the surfeit of sub-red, more red magic than blue had beenused since Gavin
								last balanced, and more green than orange. The systemwas self-regulating, initially. If
								red drafters around the world used too muchred, it would begin to get harder for them to
								draft, and simultaneously easierfor the blues. Sealed red luxin would unravel more
								easily, while sealed bluewould seal better. At that level, it was an inconvenience, an
								annoyance.
							</p>

							<p>
								Legends spoke of an era before Lucidonius came and brought the trueworship of Orholam
								when the magic centers had been spread throughoutthe world: green in what was now
								Ruthgar, red in Atash, and so forth, allworshipping pagan gods and mired in superstition
								and ignorance. Somewarlord had massacred almost all the blues. Within months, they said,
								theCerulean Sea had turned to blood, the waters choked of life. Fishermen onevery side
								of the sea had starved. The few surviving blue drafters hadheroically worked to bring
								the balance back by themselves—using so muchblue magic that they’d killed themselves.
								The seas cleared, and the reddrafters returned to drafting as before. But this time
								there were no bluedrafters left. Anything using red luxin failed, the seas turned bloody
								again,famine and disease descended.
							</p>

							<p>
								And so it went. Nearly every generation huge natural disasters wiped outthousands who
								believed they’d done something to offend their capriciousgods.
							</p>

							<p>
								Prisms prevented that. Gavin could feel what was out of balance longbefore there were
								any physical signs, and fix it by drafting the oppositecolor. When Prisms failed, as
								they inevitably did after seven, fourteen, ortwenty-one years, the Chromeria had to
								prevent disasters the hard way—inaddition to running around putting out fires (sometimes
								literally), theywould send missives throughout the world, perhaps urging blues not to
								draftunless it was an emergency, and reds to draft more than usual. Becauseeveryone
								could only draft a finite amount in their lives, that meanthastening the reds to their
								death, and keeping the blues from doing usefulwork in all of the Seven Satrapies. So at
								such times, the Chromeria sought aPrism’s replacement with great fervor. And Orholam was
								faithful to send anew Prism every generation, or so the teaching went.
							</p>

							<p>
								Except for Gavin’s generation, when in his ineffable wisdom, Orholamhad somehow sent
								two—and torn the world apart.
							</p>

							<p>
								Gavin spun in a slow circle, spreading his arms wide and releasing goutsof superviolet
								light to balance the sub-red, then red to balance blue, thenorange to balance green.
								When the world felt right once more, he stopped.
							</p>

							<p>
								He turned and smiled at the White. Her expression, as usual, was acipher. Her
								Blackguards—every one of whom was a drafter and thus had anidea of how much power Gavin
								had just handled—looked similarlyunimpressed. Or perhaps they were simply habituated. He
								was the Prism,after all. It was his job to do the impossible. If anything, they
								relaxedslightly. Their job was to protect the White, even from him, if it came to it.
							</p>

							<p>
								Gavin was the Prism, and thus ostensibly the emperor of the Seven
							</p>

							<p>
								Satrapies. In reality, his duties were mostly religious. Prisms who becametoo much more
								than just figureheads found themselves forcibly retired.Often permanently. The
								Blackguard would die to protect him from anyoneelse, but the White was the head of the
								Chromeria. If it came to it, they’dfight for her, not him. If it did, they knew they
								would likely all die, but then,that was what they trained for. Even Karris.
							</p>

							<p>
								Gavin wondered sometimes, if that ever happened, would Karris be thelast to try to kill
								him, or the first?“Karris?” the White said. “There’s a ship waiting for you, heading for
							</p>

							<p>
								Tyrea. Take this. You can read it once you set sail. When you can, scull therest of the
								way. Time is of the essence.” She handed Karris a folded note. Itwasn’t even sealed.
								Either the White trusted Karris not to even open itbefore her ship sailed, or she knew
								she’d read it immediately whether it wassealed or not. Gavin thought he knew Karris
								well, and he didn’t knowwhich she’d do.
							</p>

							<p>
								Karris took the note and bowed deeply to the White, never evenglancing at Gavin. Then
								she turned and left. Gavin couldn’t help but watchher go, her figure svelte, graceful,
								powerful, but he kept his glance brief.The White would notice regardless, but if he
								stared, she’d probably saysomething.
							</p>

							<p>
								She waved her hand as Karris disappeared down the stairs, and the restof the Blackguard
								withdrew from earshot.“So, Gavin,” she said, folding her arms. “A son. Explain.”
							</p>

							<p>
								Chapter 6
							</p>

							<p>
								Green Bridge was less than a league upstream from Rekton. Kip’s bodyscreamed at him to
								quit running, but every time he slowed his pace, heimagined the soldiers coming up the
								opposite side of the river. He had to getthere first.
							</p>

							<p>
								About twelve nightmares of enslavement and death later, he did. Isabeland Ramir and
								Sanson were relaxing against the bridge, fishing. Isabel wasbundled against the cold,
								watching while Sanson tried to tease out rainbowtrout and Ram told him how he was doing
								it wrong. They all looked at Kipas he bent over, puffing. No sight of soldiers
								anywhere.“Gotta go,” Kip said in between breaths. “Soldiers coming.”“Oh, no, oh, no! Not
								soldiers!” Ram said in mock panic.Sanson jumped to his feet, thinking Ramir was serious.
								Sanson wasbucktoothed and gullible, good-natured, always the last to get a joke and
								themost likely to be the butt of it.“Relax, Sanson. I’m joking,” Ramir said, punching
								Sanson’s shoulder,too hard.
							</p>

							<p>
								When they’d first heard about the recruiters demanding levies, it hadtaken them about a
								second to conclude that if one of them were pressed intoKing Garadul’s service, it would
								be Ram. At sixteen, he was a year olderthan the rest of them, and the only one who
								seemed remotely like a soldier.“I’m not,” Kip said, still bent over, hands on his knees,
								breathing hard.Still uncertain, Sanson said, “My ma said the alcaldesa had a big
								fightwith the king’s man. She said the alcaldesa told him to stick those orders inhis
								ear.”“If I know the alcaldesa, she didn’t say ear,” Isa said. She grinnedwickedly, and
								Sanson and Ram laughed. They just weren’t getting it.
							</p>

							<p>
								Kip saw Isa look at Ram—just a quick glance, looking for his approval.
							</p>

							<p>
								As she found it, Kip saw her pleasure double, and he felt sick in hisstomach.
								Again.“What’s going on, Kip?” she asked. Big brown eyes, full lips, fullcurves, flawless
								skin. It was impossible to talk to her and not be aware ofher beauty. Prettier even than
								Liv, really, and infinitely more here.
							</p>

							<p>
								Kip tried to find words. People are coming to kill us, and I’m worriedabout some girl
								who doesn’t even like me.
							</p>

							<p>
								From Green Bridge, it was three or four hundred paces to the nearestorange grove. There
								was precious little cover between the bridge and thetrees.“There are—” Kip started, but
								Ram ran right over his words.“If they conscript me, I’m going to volunteer to become a
								battle drafter,”
							</p>

							<p>
								Ram said. “It’s dangerous, I know, but if I have to leave everything I lovehere, I’m
								going to make something of myself.” He looked into the distance,off to a grand future.
								Kip wanted to punch him in his handsome, heroicface.“Why don’t you and Sanson run off?”
								Ram asked. “You know, hidefrom the big bad army? Isa and I want to say goodbye.”“Why
								can’t you say goodbye with us here?” Sanson asked.Isa blushed.Ram’s eyes flashed.
								“Seriously, you two, don’t be assholes, huh?” hesaid, pretending to be joking.“Ram,
								listen,” Kip said. “The army is coming to make an example of us.
							</p>

							<p>
								We need to leave. Right. Now. Master Danavis said they’d seize thebridge.” In fact,
								Green Bridge itself was a relic from the last army that camethrough. It was all green
								luxin—the most durable luxin: when sealed, itbroke down more slowly than any other kind.
								They said that when GavinGuile had led his army through here on his way to crush his
								evil brotherDazen Guile’s army, Gavin Guile, the Prism himself, had drafted thisbridge.
								By himself. In seconds. The army had pushed through withoutslowing, though its foragers
								had stolen all the food and livestock still intown. All the men in the town had been
								pressed into service on one side orthe other.
							</p>

							<p>
								It was why they had all grown up without fathers. No one in Rektonshould treat an army
								passing through as a light matter. Not even thechildren.“Do me a favor, Tubby. I’ll make
								it up to you,” Ram said.“If you go with the soldiers, you won’t be here to make it up to
								me,” Kipsaid. He wanted to kill Ram when he called him Tubby.
							</p>

							<p>
								An ugly look passed over Ram’s features. They’d fought before, and
							</p>

							<p>
								Ram won every time. But it was never easy. Kip could take a lot ofpunishment, and
								sometimes he went crazy. They both knew it. Ram said,“So do me a favor, huh?”“We have to
								go!” Kip nearly shouted. He didn’t know why he wassurprised. It was no mistake they
								always called Ramir Ram. He picked agoal and went straight at it, bashing down anything
								in his path, neverveering right or left. His goal today was to take Isabel’s maidenhead.
								Thatsimple. No mere invading army was going to stop the stupid animal.“Fine. Come on,
								Isa, we’ll go to the orange grove,” Ram said. “Anddon’t think I’ll forget this, Kip.”
							</p>

							<p>
								Ram took her hand and pulled her into a walk. She went with him butturned, looking over
								her shoulder at Kip, as if expecting him to dosomething.
							</p>

							<p>
								But what could he do? They were actually going the right direction. Ifhe went over there
								and punched Ram in the face, Ram would beat himbloody—and worse, they’d both be out in
								the open. If Kip followed on theirheels, Ram might assume he was trying to start a fight
								even if he wasn’t,with the same result.
							</p>

							<p>
								Isabel was still looking at him. She was so beautiful it hurt.Kip could stay. Do
								nothing. Hide under the bridge.No!Kip cursed. Isa looked back as he emerged from Green
								Bridge’s shadow.
							</p>

							<p>
								Her eyes widened, and he thought he saw the shadow of a smile touch herlips. Real joy at
								seeing Kip pursue her and be a man, or just venal delight inbeing fought over? Then her
								gaze shifted up and left, to the opposite bankof the river. Surprised.
							</p>

							<p>
								There was a man’s yell from above, but over the hiss of the waters Kipcouldn’t
								understand what he said. Ram stumbled as he reached the top ofthe riverbank. He didn’t
								catch himself. Instead, he dropped to his knees,tottered, and fell backward.
							</p>

							<p>
								It was only when Ram’s limp body rolled over that Kip saw the arrowsticking out of his
								back.
							</p>

							<p>
								Isa saw it too. She looked at whoever was on the bank, glanced at Kip,and then bolted in
								the other direction.“Kill her,” a man commanded in a loud clear voice, on the
								bridgedirectly above Kip. His voice was passionless.
							</p>

							<p>
								Kip felt sick, helpless. He’d wasted too much time. His mind refusedwhat his eyes
								reported. Isa was running along the bank of the river, fast.She’d always been fast, but
								there was nowhere to hide, no cover from thearrow Kip knew was coming. His heart
								hammered in his chest, roared in hisears, and then, suddenly, its rate doubled, tripled.
							</p>

							<p>
								The barest shadow flicked at the corner of his eye: the arrow. Kip’s armspasmed as if he
								himself had been struck. A flash of blue, barely visible,thin and reedy, darted from him
								into the air.
							</p>

							<p>
								The arrow splashed into the river, a good fifteen paces away from Isa.
							</p>

							<p>
								The archer cursed. Kip looked down at his hands. They were trembling—and blue. As
								achingly bright blue as the sky. He was so stunned he froze fora moment.
							</p>

							<p>
								He looked back to Isa, now more than a hundred paces away. There wasthe same flicker of
								a shadow as another arrow passed from the periphery ofhis vision to the center of
								it—right into Isa’s back. She pitched face firstonto the rough stones of the riverbank,
								but as Kip watched, she got back upto her knees slowly, the arrow jutting from her lower
								back, hands and facestreaming blood. She was almost to her feet when the next arrow
								thuddedinto her back. She dropped face first into the shallows of the river andmoved no
								more.
							</p>

							<p>
								Kip stood there stupidly, disbelieving. His vision narrowed to the pointwhere crimson
								life swirled from Isa’s back into the clear water of the river.
							</p>

							<p>
								Hoofbeats clopped loudly on the bridge above them. Kip’s mindchurned.“Sir, the men are
								ready,” a man said above them. “But… sir, this is ourown town.” Kip looked up. The green
								luxin of the bridge overhead wastranslucent, and he could see the shadows of the
								men—which meant that ifhe or Sanson moved, the soldiers might see them too.
							</p>

							<p>
								Silence, then, coldly, the same officer who had demanded Isa die said,“So we should let
								subjects choose when to obey their king? Perhapsobeying my orders should be optional,
								too?”“No, sir. It’s just…”“Are you finished?”“Yes, sir.”“Then burn it down. Kill them
								all.”
							</p>

							<p>
								Chapter 7“You’re not even going to pretend that you don’t read my mail?” Gavinasked.
							</p>

							<p>
								The White barked a laugh. “Why insult your intelligence?”“I could think of half a dozen
								reasons, which means you could probablythink of a hundred,” Gavin said.“You’re avoiding
								the question. Do you have a son?” Despite her doggeddetermination to get the answer—and
								Gavin knew she wouldn’t let himdodge this, artfully or not—she kept her voice down. She
								understood, betterthan anyone, the gravity of the situation. Even the Blackguards
								wouldn’thear this. But if she had read his unsealed mail, anyone else could have too.“To
								the best of my knowledge, it’s not true. I don’t see how it could be.”“Because you’ve
								been careful, or because it’s actually impossible?”“You don’t really expect me to answer
								that,” Gavin said.“I understand that a Prism faces substantial temptations, and I
								appreciateyour temperance or discretion over the years, whichever it’s been. I
								haven’thad to deal with pregnant young drafters or irate fathers demanding that yoube
								forced to marry their daughters. I thank you for that. In return, I haven’tjoined your
								father in pressing you to marry, though that would doubtlesssimplify your life and mine.
								You’re a smart man, Gavin. Smart enough, Ihope, that you know you can ask me for a new
								room slave, or more roomslaves, or whatever you require. Otherwise, I hope that you are…
								verycareful.”
							</p>

							<p>
								Gavin coughed. “None more so.”“I don’t pretend to be able to track all your comings and
								goings, but tothe best of my knowledge, you haven’t been to Tyrea since the
								war.”“Sixteen years,” Gavin said quietly. Sixteen years? Has he really beendown there
								for sixteen years? What would the White do if she found out mybrother is alive? That
								I’ve been keeping him in a special hell beneath thisvery tower?
							</p>

							<p>
								Her eyebrows lifted, reading something else in his troubled expression.“Ah. A great many
								things may be done during war by men and women whothink they may die. Those were wilder
								days for you. So perhaps thisrevelation is a particular problem.”
							</p>

							<p>
								Gavin’s heart stopped cold. For all of a thousand things that hadhappened sixteen years
								ago, the one that was most important now was thatduring the time the child must have
								been sired, Gavin had been betrothed toKarris.“If you’re absolutely certain that this
								isn’t true,” the White said, “I’llsend a man to take the note from Karris. I was trying
								to do you a favor. Youknow her temper. I figured it would be best for both of you if she
								learnedabout this while she is away. After her head cools, I imagine she’ll forgiveyou.
								But if you swear it isn’t true, then there’s no need for her to know atall, is there?”
							</p>

							<p>
								For a moment, Gavin wondered at the old crone. The White was beingkind, no doubt, but
								she had also orchestrated this situation to happen rightin front of her—and the only
								reason for her to do that was so she could seeGavin’s most honest reaction. It was kind
								and cruel and cunning all at once,and by no means accidental. Gavin reminded himself for
								the hundredth timenot to get on the wrong side of Orea Pullawr.“I have no recollection
								of this woman. None. But it was a terrible time.
							</p>

							<p>
								I, I cannot swear it.” He knew how the White would take that. She thoughthe was
								admitting to cheating on Karris during their betrothal, but that hebelieved he’d always
								been careful. But young men make mistakes.“I should go,” he said. “I’ll get to the
								bottom of it. This is my mess.”“No,” she said flatly. “Now it’s Karris’s. I’m not
								sending you to Tyrea,
							</p>

							<p>
								Gavin. You’re the Prism. It’s bad enough that I have to send you after colorwights—”“You
								don’t send me. You just don’t stop me.”It had been their first titanic clash of wills.
								She refused to let a Prismendanger himself, called it madness. Gavin hadn’t made any
								arguments atall, just refused to be stopped. She’d confined him to his apartments.
								He’dblown the doors off.
							</p>

							<p>
								Eventually, she gave in, and he paid for it in other ways.A moment passed, and she said
								very quietly, gently, “After all this time,
							</p>

							<p>
								Gavin, after all the wights you’ve killed and all the people you’ve saved,does it hurt
								any less?”“I hear there’s some talk of heresy,” Gavin said brusquely. “Someonepreaching
								the old gods again. I could go find out.”“You’re not the promachos anymore, Gavin.”“It’s
								not like any fifty of their half-trained drafters could stop—”“What you are is the best
								Prism we’ve had in fifty, maybe a hundredyears. And they might have fifty-one drafters,
								or five hundred at their littleheretical Chromeria, so I won’t hear of it. Karris will
								check on this womanand her son and see what she can learn as she investigates this
								‘King’Garadul. You can expect her return within two months. And speaking ofcolor wights,
								an unusually powerful blue wight was just seen on theoutskirts of the Blood Forest,
								heading toward Ru.”
							</p>

							<p>
								A blue wight heading toward the reddest lands in the world. Odd. Andblues were usually
								so logical. It was a distraction, but it was a good one,and it left him almost no time
								to reach Karris. “By your leave, then, HighLady,” he said, his good manners always
								partly ironical. He didn’t wait forher approval before he gathered his magic and jogged
								toward the edge ofthe tower.“Oh no you don’t!” she said.He stopped. Sighed.
								“What?”“Gavin!” she scolded. “Surely you didn’t forget you promised to teachtoday. It’s
								a high honor for each class to meet with you. They wait monthsfor this.”“Which class?”
								he asked suspiciously.“Superviolets. There’s only six of them.”“Isn’t that the class
								with the girl always spilling out of her top? Lana?
							</p>

							<p>
								Ana?” It was one thing when women pursued Gavin, but that girl had beenthrowing herself
								at him since she was fourteen.
							</p>

							<p>
								The White looked pained. “We have spoken with that one a few times.”“Look,” Gavin said,
								“the tide is going out, I have to catch Karris. I’llteach that class next time you see
								me. No excuses, no fight.”“You give me your word?”“I give you my word.”
							</p>

							<p>
								The White smiled like a sated cat. “You enjoy teaching more than youadmit, don’t you,
								Gavin?”“Gah!” Gavin said. “Goodbye!”Before she could say anything else, he sprinted for
								the edge of the towerand leapt into space.
							</p>

							<p>
								Chapter 8
							</p>

							<p>
								Kip was staring at Isa’s body. After she’d seen the soldiers kill Ram, she’dlooked back
								at Kip. She’d been looking for safety, for protection. She’dlooked at him, and she’d
								known he couldn’t save her.
							</p>

							<p>
								A sound and a sudden absence next to him made Kip tear his eyes awayfrom Isa. Sanson was
								running toward the village. Sanson wasn’t smart, buthe’d always been practical. He
								hadn’t done anything so dumb in his life.But Kip couldn’t blame him. They’d never seen
								anyone die, either.
							</p>

							<p>
								But there was no way the soldiers could fail to see Sanson, and nowhe’d die too if Kip
								didn’t do anything.
							</p>

							<p>
								Kip had stood around enough, doing nothing while his friends died. Hedidn’t think. He
								acted. He ran—the other way.
							</p>

							<p>
								Kip hated running. When Ram ran, it was like watching a hunting houndspeed after a deer,
								all hard lean muscles and flowing strength. When Isa ran,it was like watching the deer
								flee, all easy grace and surprising speed. Kiprunning was like a milk cow lumbering out
								to pasture. Still, no one wasexpecting him.
							</p>

							<p>
								He made it to Ram’s body and to full speed before he heard a shout. Hecrashed up the
								bank of the river, barely slowing. Once he got his massmoving, it took a lot to stop
								him.
							</p>

							<p>
								A dead tree, its trunk rising to shin level, mostly hidden in the longgrasses, counted
								as a lot. Kip’s shin cracked into wood in midstride, and hepitched forward. He skidded
								on his face and then flopped over like a fish.Pain blurred his vision black and red. For
								a second, he thought he wasgoing to throw up, then he went lightheaded. He looked down,
								fullyexpecting bone to be jutting out of his leg. Nothing. Wimp.
							</p>

							<p>
								Tears streamed from his eyes. His hands were bleeding again,fingernails torn. He heard
								the men on the bridge shouting. They’d lost himfor the moment, but horsemen were coming.
								He wasn’t fifty paces away.The grasses were only knee high. The horsemen would see him
								any secondnow, and then he’d die. Just like Isa.
							</p>

							<p>
								He staggered to his feet, his shin afire, tears blurring the world. He hatedhimself.
								Crying because he fell down. Because he was clumsy. Because hewas weak.
							</p>

							<p>
								The horsemen gave a yell as he stood. Kip had seen King Garadul’shorsemen pass through
								town before, but never in full battle harness. Whenthey passed through Rekton, their
								harnesses were always stowed. Rektonwasn’t even big enough to be worth showing off for.
								The two horsemengalloping toward Kip were both part of the lower cavalry. Barely able
								toafford their own ponies, weapons, and armor, they served only during thedry season.
								Amateur warriors, hoping to bring home loot and lies before theharvests. Both were
								dressed in mail-and-plate jackets. Lighter and cheaperthan the full plate worn by the
								lords and King Garadul’s Mirrormen, theselong jackets bore six narrow rows of thin,
								overlapping plates down thefront, with four-to-one riveted mail for the sleeves and
								back. Each wore atoep, a round helmet with a spike on top and vulture plumes sticking
								upbeside them. A mail aventail draped down over the shoulders, protecting theneck and
								giving double-thickness mail over the upper chest. Neither carrieda lance. Instead, they
								bore vechevorals, sickle-swords. The weapons had along handle like an ax and a
								crescent-moon-shaped blade at the end, withthe inward bowl-shaped side being the cutting
								edge. The horsemen werejostling each other for the better line, laughing, competing to
								see whowould hack the child.
							</p>

							<p>
								The laughter did it. It was one thing to give up and die, it was somethingelse to let
								some giggling morons murder you. But there was no time. Thehorsemen had reached a full
								gallop, trampling the tender, radiant greengrass the way they would trample Kip. They
								finally split, one switching hisvechevoral to his left hand so they could cut Kip down
								simultaneously.
							</p>

							<p>
								Kip lashed out, jumping, determined to at least punch one stupid grin tooblivion before
								he died. It was a poor jump, and far too early. But as Kip’sbody rose to meet the
								extended lances, a radiant green mass rose throughhim. He felt energy rush out from his
								body. A dozen blades of grass rosethrough his hand, with his punch, tearing his skin as
								they ripped out of him.
							</p>

							<p>
								They thickened to the width of boar spears as green light poured from him,and became
								blades in truth. As he threw them into the air, Kip was thrownback down to the ground.
								The butts of a dozen radiant jade spears thunkedinto the ground around him.
							</p>

							<p>
								The horsemen barely had time to jerk on their reins before they rammedinto a wall of
								spears. Their vechevorals went flying out of their hands astheir horses were impaled,
								lifted off the ground by the angle of the spears,snapping those in front with the force
								of their impact, only to find morebehind those and be impaled further. The riders were
								thrown from theirsaddles into the waiting green spears. The lighter of the two caught
								and washeld, five feet off the ground. The heavier rider snapped off the spears andfell
								flat on his back beside Kip.
							</p>

							<p>
								For a long, stupid moment, Kip had no idea what had happened. Heheard a shout from the
								bridge: “Drafter! Green drafter!” He looked at hishands. Radiant green was slowly
								leaking from his bloody fingertips—theexact shade of the grass, and the spears. There
								were cuts at his knuckles,wrists, and under his nails, like something had ripped the
								skin on its wayout. A scent like resin and cedar filled the air.
							</p>

							<p>
								Kip felt woozy. Someone was cursing in a low, desperate voice. Heturned.
							</p>

							<p>
								It was the soldier, bleeding on the ground near him. Kip had no idea howthe man was
								still alive. There were four spears through his body, but theywere disappearing now,
								bowing under their own weight, shimmering as ifon some tiny level they were boiling away
								into nothingness. The soldiersucked in a breath. The movement made the two spears
								through his chestshift. The soldier whimpered and cursed, and slowly the spears
								disappeared,leaving only chalky green grit to mix with his blood. Despite the
								mailhanging askew across the man’s face, Kip could see the gleam of his darkeyes,
								shining with tears.
							</p>

							<p>
								For a few moments, Kip had felt connected. The green was unity,growth, wildness,
								wholeness. But as it slipped from his fingers, the greatspears bowing like wilting
								flowers, he felt alone once more. Scared. Thesmaller rider who’d been held off the
								ground was released with a thump andthe clanging of mail as he hit the ground. The
								spears shimmered, dissipated,and blew apart like heavy dust.
							</p>

							<p>
								Kip heard weeping. It was the bigger rider, still cursing. The man drewin a great breath
								and abruptly coughed, spitting blood all through the mailover his face. He turned over
								onto his stomach, and more blood poured outof his broken toep.
							</p>

							<p>
								Kip turned away. He looked toward the bridge. The king’s soldiers weregone. Kip could
								only guess that they had assumed that some trained drafterhad shown up to rescue him.
								Maybe they would wait until dark to comeafter him, or maybe they had their own drafter
								back at camp. Either way,Kip had to run, fast.
							</p>

							<p>
								He turned on wobbly legs, fingers stinging, his brain thick with grief andexhaustion,
								and stumbled toward the orange grove.
							</p>

							<p>
								Chapter 9
							</p>

							<p>
								Gavin Guile plunged past classrooms and barracks and knew that not a fewpeople would
								rush to the windows to see what came next. In fact, this wasthe first day of drafting
								classes for the dims, so he was probably about to bea perfect illustration of one of the
								primary lessons every magister taught.
							</p>

							<p>
								The magister would light a candle and instruct the students to commenton what was
								happening. This always gave the magisters plenty ofopportunities to abuse the bewildered
								children, who would invariably say,“It’s burning.” “But what do you mean by this word,
								‘burning’?” “Uh, it’sburning?” The eventual point was that every fire began on
								somethingtangible and left almost nothing tangible. When a candle burned, where didall
								the tallow go? Into power—power we experience as light and heat, withsome
								residue—whether much or little depended on how efficiently thecandle burned.
							</p>

							<p>
								Magic was the converse. It began with power—light or heat—and itsexpression was always
								physical. You made luxin. You could touch it, hold it—or be held by it.
							</p>

							<p>
								Halfway down, Gavin drafted a blue bonnet and a harness from the coldblue of the sky
								with some green added for flexibility. It unfurled with a popand slowed his fall. When
								he was a few paces from the ground, he threwdown blastwaves of sub-red that slowed him
								enough that he could landlightly in the street. The bonnet dissolved into blue dust and
								green grit and asmell like resin, chalk, and cedar. He strode toward the docks.
							</p>

							<p>
								He found her within minutes, just arriving at the docks herself, a bagslung over her
								shoulder. She’d changed from her Blackguard uniform, butwas still wearing pants. Karris
								only wore a dress once a year, for the
							</p>

							<p>
								Luxlords’ Ball, where it was required. She’d also somehow dyed her hairalmost black so
								as not to stand out so much in Tyrea.
							</p>

							<p>
								Of course, it was impossible not to stand out with those eyes, like anemerald sky
								adorned with ruby stars. Karris was a green/red bichrome—almost a polychrome. It was an
								“almost” she’d hated all her life. Her red arcextended into the sub-red so far that she
								could draft fire, but she couldn’tdraft stable sub-red luxin. She’d failed the
								examination. Twice. It didn’tmatter that she could draft more sub-red than most sub-red
								drafters, or thatshe was the fastest drafter Gavin had ever seen. She wasn’t a
								polychrome.
							</p>

							<p>
								But on the other hand, polychromes were too valuable to be allowed tojoin the
								Blackguard.“Karris!” Gavin called out, jogging to catch up with her.She stopped and
								waited for him, a quizzical look on her face. “Lord
							</p>

							<p>
								Prism,” she said in greeting, ever proper in public—and still, evidently, nothaving read
								the note.
							</p>

							<p>
								He fell in step beside her. “So,” he said. “Tyrea.”“The armpit of the Seven Satrapies
								itself,” she said.Five years, five great purposes, Gavin. He’d given himself
								purposessince he’d first become Prism as a focus and distraction. Seven goals foreach
								seven-year stint. And the first was—the first had always been—to tellKarris the whole
								truth. A truth that might ruin everything. What I did. Why.And why I broke our betrothal
								fifteen years ago.
							</p>

							<p>
								And you can rot in that blue hell forever for that, brother.“Important mission,” he
								said.She shrugged. “How come the important missions never take me to
							</p>

							<p>
								Ruthgar or the Blood Forest?”
							</p>

							<p>
								He chuckled. Ruthgar was the most civilized and prosperous nation inthe Seven Satrapies,
								and of course, as a green drafter, Karris would feel astrong fondness for the Verdant
								Plains. Alternately, the Blood Forest waswhere her people were from, and she hadn’t
								walked among the redwoodssince she was young. “Why don’t you make it a quick trip, then?
								I can scullyou there.”“To Tyrea? It’s on the opposite side of the sea!”“It’s on my way
								to a color wight I’ve got to deal with.” And I may nothave many more chances to be near
								you.
							</p>

							<p>
								She scowled. “Seems like there’ve been a lot of wights recently.”“It always seems like
								there’ve been a lot recently. Remember lastsummer, when there were six in six days, and
								then none for three months?”“I guess so. What kind?” she asked. Like most drafters, she
								felt a specialoutrage when a wight had come from her own color.“A blue.”“Ah. So I’m
								guessing you’ll be right on your way.” Karris knew about
							</p>

							<p>
								Gavin’s special hatred for blue wights. “Wait, you’re hunting a bluewight… in Tyrea?”
								she asked, turning to look at him with her hauntinggreen eyes with red flecks.“Outside
								Ru, actually.” He cleared his throat.She laughed. At thirty-two, she had the faintest
								lines on her face—morefrown lines than smile lines, sadly, but she still had the same
								dimples. It justwasn’t fair. After years of knowing her, a woman’s beauty shouldn’t be
								ableto reach straight into a man’s chest and squeeze the breath out of him.Especially
								not when he could never have her. “Tyrea’s a thousand leaguesfrom Ru!”“Couple hundred at
								most. If you stop wasting daylight arguing with me,
							</p>

							<p>
								I might be able to get you there before nightfall.”“Gavin, that’s impossible. Even for
								you. And even if it were possible, Icouldn’t ask you—”“You didn’t. I volunteered. Now
								tell me, would you really prefer tospend two weeks on a corvette? It’s clear today, but
								you know how thosestorms come up. I heard the last time you sailed, you got so green you
								coulddraft off your own skin.”“Gavin…”“Important mission, isn’t it?” he asked.“The
								White’s going to kill you for this. She’s got an ulcer named afteryou, you know.
								Literally.”“I’m the Prism. There’s got to be some advantages. And I like
								sculling.”“You’re impossible,” she said, surrendering.“We all have our special little
								talents.”
							</p>

							<p>
								Chapter 10
							</p>

							<p>
								Kip woke to the smell of oranges and smoke. It was still hot, the eveningsun slipping
								through the leaves to tickle his face. Somehow, he had made itto one of the orange
								groves before collapsing. He looked down the long,perfect rows for any soldiers before
								he stood up. His head still felt foggy,but the smell of smoke drove away any thoughts of
								himself.
							</p>

							<p>
								As he approached the edge of the orange grove, the stench grewstronger, the air thick.
								Kip caught flashes of light in the distance. Heemerged from the grove and saw the sun
								setting behind the alcaldesa’smansion, the tallest building in Rekton. As he watched,
								the sun went from abeautiful deep red to something darker, angry. Then Kip saw the light
								again—fire. Thick smoke billowed suddenly into the sky, and as if on signal,smoke
								billowed up from a dozen places in the town. In moments, the smokeblossomed to raging
								fires towering dozens of paces above the roofs.
							</p>

							<p>
								Kip heard screams. A ruin of an old statue lay in the orange grove. Thetownsfolk had
								always called it the Broken Man. Much of it had dissolved inthe centuries since its
								fall, but the head mostly remained. Someone had longago carved steps into the broken
								neck. The head was tall enough to watchthe sun rise over the orange trees. It was a
								favorite spot for couples. Kipclambered up the steps.
							</p>

							<p>
								The town was on fire. Hundreds of foot soldiers surrounded the town ina vast, loose
								circle. As the flames drove some townsfolk from their hidingplace, Kip saw King
								Garadul’s horsemen set their lances. It was old MissDelclara and her six sons, the
								quarrymen. The biggest one, Micael, wascarrying her over one burly shoulder. He was
								shouting at the others, but Kipcouldn’t hear what he was saying. The brothers ran
								together toward theriver, apparently hoping to find safety there.
							</p>

							<p>
								They weren’t going to make it.The horsemen lowered their lances as they reached a full
								gallop, maybethirty paces away from the fleeing family.“Now!” Micael yelled. Kip could
								hear it from where he stood.Five of the brothers dropped to the ground. Zalo was too
								slow. A lancepunched through his back and sent him sprawling. Two of the others
								wereskewered as their pursuers quickly adjusted their aim and caught the menlow to the
								ground. Micael’s pursuer dipped his lance too, but missed. Hecaught the ground instead,
								and the lance stuck.
							</p>

							<p>
								The horseman didn’t release his lance in time, and was slammed out ofhis saddle by the
								force of his own charge.
							</p>

							<p>
								Micael ran over to the fallen soldier and drew the man’s ownvechevoral. With a savage
								chop, despite the layers of mail, he nearly cut theman’s head off.
							</p>

							<p>
								But the other horsemen had drawn rein already, and in seconds there wasa forest of
								flashing steel blocking Micael, his brother, and his mother fromKip’s view.
							</p>

							<p>
								Kip felt like he was going to throw up. At some signal he didn’t see orhear, the
								horsemen formed back up and charged off toward new victims inthe distance. Kip was only
								glad that they were far enough away he couldn’trecognize them.
							</p>

							<p>
								Around the rest of the town, the foot soldiers were moving in.Mother! Kip had been
								watching the town burn for several minutes, andhe hadn’t thought about anything. His
								mother was in there. He had to go toher.
							</p>

							<p>
								How was he going to get into the town? Even if he could get past thesoldiers and the
								fire, was his mother even still alive? The king’s men hadseen the direction he had run
								away, too. They would think that the “drafter”they’d seen earlier was the only threat in
								the whole area. Surely they wouldbe watching for him. In fact, they might have men out
								hunting him now.
							</p>

							<p>
								If so, perching on the highest point in the orange grove was probably notthe smartest
								thing to do.
							</p>

							<p>
								As if on signal, Kip heard a branch snap. It might have been a deer.
							</p>

							<p>
								Evening was coming on after all. There were lots of deer in the orangegroves after—
							</p>

							<p>
								Not thirty paces away, someone cursed.Talking deer?Kip dropped to his stomach. He
								couldn’t breathe. He couldn’t move.
							</p>

							<p>
								They were going to kill him. Just like they killed the Delclaras. MicaelDelclara was
								big. Tough as old oak. And they’d slaughtered him.
							</p>

							<p>
								Move, Kip, just move. His heart was a riot in his chest. He was shaking.
							</p>

							<p>
								He was taking tiny breaths, way too fast. Slow down, Kip. Breathe. He tooka deep breath
								and tore his eyes away from his trembling hands.
							</p>

							<p>
								There was a cave not far from here. Kip had found his mother thereonce, after she’d
								disappeared for three days. There’d long been rumors ofsmugglers’ caves in the area, and
								whenever his mother ran out of haze andmoney she went looking for them. She’d finally
								gotten lucky about twoyears ago and found enough of the drug that she hadn’t come home.
								WhenKip had found her, she hadn’t eaten for days. She’d nearly died. He’doverheard
								someone saying aloud that they wished she had, for his sake.
							</p>

							<p>
								Reaching the ground, Kip started jogging, trying to keep the ruinbetween himself and the
								man he’d heard. He ran about as fast as Sansonwould run if Sanson carried another Sanson
								on his back. So Kip jogged,trying to be quiet, zigzagging through the straight rows of
								trees. Then heheard a sound that froze his bones to the marrow: dogs barking.
							</p>

							<p>
								Fueled by fear, Kip found a flat-out run. He ignored the burning in hislegs, the
								stabbing in his lungs. He was already headed toward the river; thecave was on its banks.
								He heard a soldier shouting curses, maybe twohundred paces back, maybe less. “Keep those
								dogs on the lead! You want tofind a drafter while it’s still light out?”
							</p>

							<p>
								It was getting darker by the minute. So that was why he was still alive.
							</p>

							<p>
								With all colors muted by darkness, drafters weren’t nearly as powerful atnight. And
								between the smoke and a bank of black clouds rolling in, the skywas darkening faster
								than normal. If they’d let the dogs go, they’d have runhim down already. But with
								darkness coming on so fast, they might feelsafe to let them go at any minute.
							</p>

							<p>
								Suddenly, Kip was on the riverbank. He stepped on one pant leg andalmost fell down,
								barely catching himself with one hand. He stopped. Thecave was upstream, away from town,
								not two hundred paces away. Hepicked up two stones that fit nicely in his hands. If he
								had the cave toprotect his sides and back, he could… What? Die slowly?
							</p>

							<p>
								He looked at the rocks in his hands. Rocks. Against soldiers and wardogs. He was stupid.
								Insane. He looked at the rocks again, then threw oneonto the opposite bank of the river,
								downstream. He threw the second rockfarther. Then he grabbed two more, rubbed them
								against his body, andthrew them as far as he could. The last one crashed through the
								branches ofa willow tree. Lousy throw.
							</p>

							<p>
								No time to mourn his ineptitude. Kip’s scent trail already was headedupstream—the
								direction he did need to go. He’d just have to hope. It was apathetic attempt, but he
								had nothing else. He kept moving upstream up thebank, trying to ignore the sound of the
								barking dogs closing in. Then hestepped into the river, careful not to let his clothes
								touch any dry rocks. Theplace where he had come to the river was a bend, so soon he was
								out of theline of sight.“Let the dogs go!” the same voice shouted.Then Kip was opposite
								the cave entrance. It was invisible from the river,obscured by boulders that had fallen
								in front of the opening. But as soon ashe stepped out of the river, he’d be leaving
								scent for the dogs, and a visualtrail of wet rocks for the soldiers. He couldn’t get out
								of the water. Not yet.He looked up at the black clouds.
							</p>

							<p>
								Don’t just sit there. Give me some rain!“What’s the problem? What’s wrong with them?”
								the soldier demanded.“They’re fighting dogs, sir, not trackers. I’m not even certain
								they’re onthe drafter’s trail.”
							</p>

							<p>
								Kip kept pushing upstream another hundred paces where the bend in theriver straightened
								out and a tree had fallen down the bank into the water. Itwouldn’t do anything for the
								scent trail, but it would hide the water he wasdripping. He cut up the bank and then
								stopped. If he headed backdownstream, he’d be going closer to the men hunting him. But
								the soldier’smention of other trails had put a small desperate hope in Kip’s breast.
								Othertrails meant maybe other fresh trails. And if it weren’t for the dogs, the
								cavewould be the safest place to spend the night.
							</p>

							<p>
								Swallowing so his heart didn’t jump out of his throat, Kip turneddownstream, toward the
								cave. He thought he felt a cool prick on his skin.Rain? He looked up at the black
								clouds, but it must have been hisimagination. He came to the spot overlooking the cave’s
								entrance.
							</p>

							<p>
								Two soldiers were standing almost directly below him. Two others wereon the opposite
								bank. There was one war dog on each side. Either dog’shead would have come up to Kip’s
								shoulder, easily. They both wore studdedleather coats like horse armor without the
								saddle. Kip dropped to theground.“Sir, if I may?” one of the men said. Apparently
								getting permission, thesoldier said, “The drafter came straight to the river, then
								veered sharplyupstream before going into the water? He knows we’re following him. Ithink
								he doubled back and went downstream.”“With us so close behind?” the commander asked.“He
								must have heard the dogs.”Which made Kip think of something else: dogs can smell scents
								on thewind too. Not just on the ground. Kip’s throat tightened. He hadn’t eventhought
								about the wind. It was blowing from the southwest. His path hadtaken him east and then
								north when the river turned—the perfect direction.If he’d gone downstream, toward town,
								the dogs would have smelled himimmediately. If the commander thought about it, he’d
								surely realize thattoo.“Rain’s coming. We might only have one shot at this.” The
								commanderpaused. “Let’s make it fast.” He whistled and gestured for the men on theother
								side of the river to head downstream. They took off at a jog.
							</p>

							<p>
								Kip’s heart started beating again. He slipped down the bank beside twogreat boulders.
								There was a narrow space between the two. It looked like itwent in for about four paces
								and then stopped, but Kip knew that it turnedsharply. He never would have discovered it
								the first time if it hadn’t beenfor the pungent, sickly sweet odor of haze floating out.
								Orholam knew howhis mother had ever found it.
							</p>

							<p>
								Now, even knowing it was there, Kip almost didn’t have the courage topush between those
								rocks. There was something wrong, though. It wasn’t asdark as it should be. It was fully
								night outside and Kip was blocking theentrance, so someone was already inside, and they
								had a lantern.
							</p>

							<p>
								Kip froze again until he heard the sound of the war dogs change pitch.
							</p>

							<p>
								They’d found the rocks he’d thrown across the river. That meant it was onlya matter of
								time until they discovered his fraud. The darkness and tightnesswere suffocating. He had
								to move, one way or the other.
							</p>

							<p>
								He pushed around the corner and into the open space of the smuggler’scave. There were
								two figures sitting in the wan light of a lantern: Sansonand Kip’s mother. Both were
								covered in blood.
							</p>

							<p>
								Chapter 11
							</p>

							<p>
								Kip couldn’t help but cry out. His mother was seated against the wall of thecave, her
								once-blue dress dyed black and red with blood dried and fresh.Lina’s dark hair was
								matted, darker than normal, stringy with blood. Theright side of her face was pristine,
								perfect. All the blood was coming fromthe left side of her head, traveling down her hair
								like a wick, blooming onher dress. Sanson sat next to her, his eyes closed, head back,
								clothes almostas gory.
							</p>

							<p>
								At Kip’s cry, his mother’s eyes fluttered. There was a huge dent in theside of her head.
								Orholam be merciful, her skull was shattered. She staredin his direction for several
								moments before she found him. Her eyes were ahorror to behold, the pupil of her left eye
								was dilated, the right a tightpinprick. And the whites of both were completely
								bloodshot. “Kip,” shesaid. “Never thought I’d be so happy to see you.”“Love you too,
								mother,” he said, trying to keep his tone light.“My fault,” she said. Her eyes fluttered
								and closed.Kip’s heart seized. Was she dead? Before today, he’d never seen anyonedie.
								Orholam, this was his mother! He looked at Sanson, who lookedhealthy, despite all the
								blood on his clothes. “I tried, Kip. The alcaldesawouldn’t listen. I told her—”“Even his
								own family didn’t believe him,” Kip’s mother said, her eyesstill closed. “Even when the
								soldiers rode down his mother and split hisbrother open, Adan Marta stood there, arguing
								how our satrap wouldn’tpossibly do such a thing to his own people. Only Sanson ran away.
								Whowould’ve thought he was the smart one in that family?”“Mother! Enough!” Kip’s voice
								came out whiny, childish.“You came back, though, didn’t you, Sanson? Tried to save me,
								unlikemy own son. Too bad he didn’t try to help me like you tried to help yourfamily, or
								I might still have a chance.”
							</p>

							<p>
								Her words touched some deep well of rage. Potent, but uncontrollable.
							</p>

							<p>
								He pushed it down, pushed the tears back. “Mother. Stop. You’re dying.”“Sanson says
								you’re a drafter now. Funny,” she said bitterly. “All yourlife you’re a disappointment,
								and you learn to draft today. Too late for anyof us.” With effort, she took a deep
								breath, then opened her eyes and fixedher gaze on Kip, taking a little while to focus.
								“Kill him, Kip. Kill thebastard.” She lifted a narrow, filigreed rosewood jewelry case
								as long asKip’s forearm from the floor of the cave beside her. Kip had never seen
								itbefore.
							</p>

							<p>
								Kip took the case and opened it. There was a dagger inside, double-edged, of an odd
								material, starkly white like ivory, with a thread of blackwinding down the center to the
								point, and no other adornment save forseven diamonds embedded in the blade itself. It
								was the most beautifulthing Kip had ever seen, and he didn’t care. He had no idea what
								the bladewas worth, but the case it had come in alone would have paid for a monthof his
								mother’s binges. “Mother, what is this?”“And I thought Sanson was slow,” she said, hard,
								sneering, dying,afraid. “Put it in his rotten heart. Make that bastard suffer. Make him
								payfor this.”“Mother, what are you saying?” Kip asked, despairing. Me, kill King
							</p>

							<p>
								Garadul?
							</p>

							<p>
								She laughed, and the motion made a fresh wash of blood spill down herhead. “You’re a
								stupid, stupid boy, Kip. But maybe a dull sword can gowhere a sharp one wouldn’t be
								allowed.” Her head bobbed. Her breathingwas getting labored. Her head drooped to her
								chest, and Kip thought shewas dead, but her eyes opened once more, only one focusing,
								locking Kipin her glare. Her fingernails dug into his forearm painfully. “You go,
								gotrain to be a drafter, go to the…” She seemed to be searching for the word“Chromeria,”
								but couldn’t find it. She noticed, looked furious, afraid. It wasevidence she really was
								dying. “You learn what you need, but don’t youforget me. Don’t you forget this. Don’t
								listen to him, you hear me? He’s aliar. You will not fail me in this, Kip. You learn,
								and then you kill him, youunderstand?”“Yes, mother.” She was talking like she knew King
								Garadul. How couldshe have known him?“Kip, if you ever loved me, avenge me. Swear it by
								your worthless soul,
							</p>

							<p>
								Kip. Swear it, or I swear to Orholam I’ll haunt you. I won’t… let…” Shelost her train of
								thought.
							</p>

							<p>
								Kip looked over at Sanson, who stared back silently, horrified. Kip’smother’s
								fingernails dug in deeper, and her seeing eye seemed almostaflame, demanding his
								attention, his promise. He said, “I swear to avengeyou, mother, by my very soul.”
							</p>

							<p>
								Something like peace stole over her features, softening the hard planes.
							</p>

							<p>
								Then she laughed quietly, satisfied, somehow cruel—until her laughterstopped. Her hand
								dropped from Kip’s forearm, leaving bloody tracks. “Iwon’t let you down, mother, I’ll go
								right—”
							</p>

							<p>
								She’s dead.Kip stared at her woodenly, inexplicably numb. He closed her awful,bloodshot
								eyes. “Are you hurt?” Kip asked.“Huh?” Sanson asked. “Me?”Kip stared at him, “No,
								genius, I’m talking to the dead person.” It wascruel, thoughtless.
							</p>

							<p>
								Sanson’s eyes welled up with tears. “I’m sorry, Kip. I tried to get herout. I was too
								late.” He was right on the verge of breaking down. Kip wasan ass.“No, Sanson. No, I’m
								sorry. Don’t talk like that. It’s not your fault.
							</p>

							<p>
								Listen to me. We need to act right now, not think. We’re in danger. Are youhurt?”
							</p>

							<p>
								Sanson’s eyes cleared and his chin lifted. He met Kip’s gaze. “No, thisblood is all—no,
								I’m fine.”“Then we need to go right now, while it’s dark and raining. They’ve gotdogs.
								They can track us. It’s our only chance.”“But Kip, where are we going to go?” Odd. Just
								like that, Kip was theleader. Was it that he’d found some new well of strength, or was
								Sanson justthat weak? No, don’t even think like that, Kip. He trusts you. Can’t that
								beenough?
							</p>

							<p>
								What if I’m not worthy of trust?“I’m going to be a drafter,” Kip said. “I guess. So we
								need to get to thesea. We should be able to find a ship in Garriston that’s going to
								theChromeria.”
							</p>

							<p>
								Sanson’s eyes widened, obviously thinking about what Kip’s mother hadsworn him to, but
								he said nothing but, “How do we get to Garriston?”“We float the river first.” Kip
								realized then that he’d lost the purse
							</p>

							<p>
								Master Danavis had given him. He didn’t even know when. So even if theymade it down the
								river, they wouldn’t be able to pay for the trip to theChromeria.“Kip, the soldiers were
								in a big circle around the whole town. If they’restill like that, we’ll have to cross
								through their line twice. And the town’sstill on fire. The river could be blocked.”
							</p>

							<p>
								Sanson was right, and for some reason that made Kip suddenly furious.
							</p>

							<p>
								He stopped himself. This wasn’t Sanson’s fault. Kip’s eyes felt hot. It wasso hopeless.
								He blinked rapidly. “I know it’s stupid, Sanson.” He couldn’tlook his friend in the
								eyes. “But I don’t have any other ideas. Do you?”
							</p>

							<p>
								Sanson paused for a long moment. “I saw some dead wood on the bankthat might work,” he
								said finally, and Kip knew it was his way of tellingKip he trusted him.“Then let’s go,”
								Kip said.“Kip, do you want to… I don’t know, say goodbye?” Sanson nodded inthe direction
								of Kip’s mother.
							</p>

							<p>
								Kip swallowed, holding the knife-case in a white-knuckled grip. Andsay what? I’m sorry I
								was a failure, a disappointment? That I loved you,even if you never loved me? “No,” he
								said. “Let’s go.”
							</p>

							<p>
								Chapter 12
							</p>

							<p>
								The boys crept out of the cave. Kip went first. Apparently that was the priceof becoming
								the leader. Kip had been under these same stars on the riverdozens of times, but tonight
								there was hunger in the cool air. The wind hadchanged direction, and now the smells of
								the light, misting rain opening theearth mingled with woodsmoke and the faint, fresh
								fragrance of the orangesripening on the trees. Always before, that scent had cheered
								Kip. Tonight itwas faint, ephemeral, as fragile as Kip’s chances.
							</p>

							<p>
								They made it to the river’s edge without seeing any soldiers. They’dfloated the river
								before, all four of them grabbing a few planks of wood forextra buoyancy, but mostly
								just lying back and letting the current carrythem. But they’d always waited until late
								fall, when the river was lower.Even then, they’d all sported dozens of scrapes and
								bruises from the rocksthey couldn’t avoid. It was the middle of summer now, and though
								the riverwas lower than in the spring, it was still high and swift. That meant theywould
								be able to float over rocks that would scrape them in the fall, but therocks they
								couldn’t avoid they would hit much faster.
							</p>

							<p>
								Sanson found the sticks he’d seen before while Kip waited anxiously,trying to peer
								downriver for any hint of the soldiers. The clouds over thevillage were glowing orange,
								lit by the fires below them. Sanson returnedwith a few branches, not enough for both of
								them. The boys looked at eachother. “You take them,” Kip whispered. “I float better than
								you.”“What do we do if they see us?” Sanson asked.Kip’s nerve almost failed him as he
								thought about it. What could theydo? Run away? Swim away? Even if they made it to the
								banks of the river,where could they go? The town was on fire and there were only
								fieldsaround town. Men on horses with dogs helping them would find Kip andSanson in no
								time.“Play dead,” Kip said. After all, we shouldn’t be the only bodies in thewater.
								Actually that wasn’t true; this far upstream, they should be the onlybodies in the
								water. If any of the soldiers realized that, the boys wouldquickly become real corpses.
							</p>

							<p>
								The water was cold even this far from the mountains, but it wasn’tfreezing. Kip sat down
								in it, and the current began pulling him toward town.Sanson followed. They were pulled
								around the first bend and approachingthe spot where Kip had first come to the river when
								he saw the flaw in hisplan.
							</p>

							<p>
								To play dead meant that in the sections of river that were mostdangerous, the places
								where he and Sanson would most want to see or listento find out if they’d been
								discovered, they’d have to keep their earssubmerged and their eyes fixed on the clouds
								above. If they werediscovered, Kip’s plan guaranteed that they wouldn’t know it until
								too late.
							</p>

							<p>
								They should get out of the water. He couldn’t do this. Kip glanced back.
							</p>

							<p>
								Sanson was already lying back, floating on his back, ears covered, limbsloose. He’d been
								pulled over to the other side of the river, and the currenthad already brought his
								lighter body even with Kip. Kip’s heart hammered.If he got out now, Sanson wouldn’t know
								it. Kip wouldn’t be able to grabhis friend without making so much noise that it would
								rouse anyone withinhundreds of paces.
							</p>

							<p>
								A voice spoke out of the gloom on the riverbank. “Yes, Your Majesty.
							</p>

							<p>
								We think the drafter climbed up into that tree. The dogs tracked him that farand lost
								him.”
							</p>

							<p>
								Kip saw the torch first. Someone was approaching the bank of the river,not five paces
								downstream. His first thought—to run like hell—would gethim killed. He swept his arms
								once, twice, paddling downstream, then helay back. The cold water closed over his ears,
								muffling all sound except thedesperate thumping of his pulse.
							</p>

							<p>
								The bank here was raised a pace and a half, high enough that even lyingback, Kip could
								see the man. Kip wasn’t two paces away, and the torch theman held illuminated an
								imperious face in its flickering orange light. Evenwarmed in torchlight, there was
								something fundamentally cold about thatface, an unpleasant smirk hiding in the corner of
								that mouth. The king—forKip had no doubt, even in half a second of seeing him, that this
								man was
							</p>

							<p>
								King Garadul—was not yet out of his twenties but already half bald, withthe rest of his
								hair combed to his shoulders. He had a prominent nose over atight, immaculate beard and
								thick black brows. The king stared upstream, avein on his forehead visible even in the
								torchlight, gazing at the oppositebank where Kip had crossed. His angry question was
								barely more than amurmur through the water closed around Kip’s ears.
							</p>

							<p>
								Then the king turned just as Kip was starting to get downstream of him.
							</p>

							<p>
								And he turned left, toward Kip. Kip didn’t move a muscle, but it wasn’tbecause he was
								being smart. He felt warmth blooming in the cold waterbetween his legs.
							</p>

							<p>
								It was only the torch directly between the king and Kip that saved theboys. His eyes
								went right over them, but blinded by that light in thedarkness, he saw nothing. He
								turned, swore something, and disappeared.
							</p>

							<p>
								Kip floated down the river, head back, almost disbelieving that he wasalive. The water
								was cold around him, the stars were pinpricks inOrholam’s mantle above. They were more
								beautiful than he’d ever realized.Each star had its own color, its own hue; brilliant
								rubies, startling sapphires,and even here and there an elusive emerald. For perhaps
								twenty paces, Kipfloated in utter peace, enrapt by the beauty.
							</p>

							<p>
								Then he hit a rock. It struck his foot first and spun him around so he wasfloating
								sideways. Then another rock, mostly submerged, caught his shirtand flipped him facedown
								in the water. He gasped and flailed, freezing withfear as his head came clear of the
								water and he realized how loud he’d been.
							</p>

							<p>
								A little way down the river, Sanson had pulled his head out of the waterand was staring
								at Kip with horror. How could Kip make so much noise?Kip looked away, ashamed. They
								floated in silence for a long minute,staring into the darkness, waiting to see if any
								soldiers would appear. Theydid their best to avoid the rocks, legs pointed downstream,
								hands paddlingin little circles to keep themselves afloat. But no one came.
							</p>

							<p>
								They floated as close together as they could, though Kip knew it wasunwise. Two bodies
								floating separately might not be remarkable, but twofloating side by side? Still, he
								didn’t move away. Silence settled over theboys as they came closer and closer to the
								bridge where their friends haddied that morning. It seemed so long ago now.
							</p>

							<p>
								And then Kip saw her, lying on the riverbank. The soldiers who’dmurdered Isa had pulled
								their arrows out of her body. But aside fromturning her over, they hadn’t moved her
								corpse. She lay on her back, eyesopen, head turned left toward Kip, dark hair waving in
								the river. One armwas raised over her head, not drifting in the current but instead
								stiff as afelled tree. The underside of her arm and even her face was a horrific
								darkpurple with pooled blood.
							</p>

							<p>
								Kip put his feet down on the slick rocks of the riverbed to go to her. Hewas about to
								stand when some sixth sense stopped him. He hesitated and,still lying in the water,
								looked around as much as he could.
							</p>

							<p>
								There! Standing on the bridge, with only his head visible, the soldierkept watch. So
								they weren’t stupid. They’d figured that whoever thisdrafter was that they’d run into
								earlier, he’d have the decency to come backand bury his friends.
							</p>

							<p>
								The current was carrying Kip downstream. No decision was a decision.But what could he
								do? Face soldiers? If there was one, there might beten, and if ten, maybe a hundred. Kip
								was no fighter, he was a child. He wasfat, weak. One man would be one man too many.
							</p>

							<p>
								Kip turned away from Isa’s corpse and lay back in the water once more.
							</p>

							<p>
								He didn’t want to remember her like this anyway. A knot formed in histhroat, so hard and
								so tight it threatened to strangle him. Only his fear of thesoldier above kept him from
								crying as he floated under Green Bridge.
							</p>

							<p>
								He didn’t even think of the dagger in its ornate case strapped to his backuntil they
								were far downstream. He could’ve tried; he could’ve at leastgotten out of the water and
								taken a look. Isa deserved more.
							</p>

							<p>
								Soon they were drifting into town, where the river flowed in a narrower,deeper channel,
								lined on each side with great rocks and crossed at intervalsby sturdy wood bridges.
							</p>

							<p>
								Parts of the town were still on fire, though Kip didn’t know whether thatwas because
								they were built of materials that were less flammable orbecause the fire had spread more
								slowly through some areas and was onlyreaching some buildings now. Soon they encountered
								their first corpse. Ahorse. Still harnessed to a wagon full of late-season oranges, it
								had beentrapped in a section of the town that was now smoldering. Maddened by thefire,
								the mare had leapt into the river. The wagon had followed and eithercrushed or drowned
								it, spilling oranges everywhere.
							</p>

							<p>
								Kip thought it might be the Sendina family’s horse and wagon. Sanson,never overly
								sentimental, grabbed a few oranges from the wreckage of thewagon and stuffed them in his
								pockets.
							</p>

							<p>
								Sanson was probably right. Kip hadn’t eaten all day, not that he’dnoticed until now, but
								he was starving. Despite feeling like he might throwup, he reached over the
								half-submerged horse and grabbed a few orangestoo.
							</p>

							<p>
								They came closer to the water market, and it kept getting hotter. Kipheard strange
								screams. There were fires still burning ahead. The watermarket was a small, circular
								lake that was dredged regularly to keep auniform depth. It was said that once both river
								and town had been muchlarger. The river, supposedly, had been navigable from below the
								falls allthe way to the Cerulean Sea, and then from Rekton all the way to themountains,
								bringing traders from all of the Seven Satrapies, hungry forTyrea’s famous oranges and
								other citrus fruits. Now, only the smallest flat-bottomed boats could make the trip
								downstream and the number of robbershappy to relieve traders of anything valuable
								convinced most farmers tosend their oranges on the slower, heavily armed, and much less
								profitablecaravans. Even the smallest, hardest, and thickest-skinned oranges sent
								bycaravans over land would rot long before they could reach the distant courtswhere
								nobles and satraps would pay a fortune for such a delicacy. So almostevery year some
								young farmer tried the river, and a few times they gotthrough, all the way to Garriston,
								and came home with a fortune—if theymanaged to avoid the robbers again on the way back.
							</p>

							<p>
								But for the most part, the trade for which the water market had beenbuilt was long dead.
								The townsfolk kept it for pride and for their own use.All the roads were already built
								around the water market, all theirstorehouses surrounded, so they maintained the barges
								and floated aroundthe circle every market day according to rules and an etiquette that
								nooutsider could hope to understand. In the middle of the water market was anisland,
								connected by a drawbridge to the north shore.
							</p>

							<p>
								As they came fully in sight of the island, Kip saw where the screams hadcome from. The
								drawbridge was down, and the island was filled withhundreds of animals trapped by the
								fires closing in around them. Even thedrawbridge, straining with the weight of dozens of
								horses, sheep, pigs, anda grotesque carpet of rats, was smoking at one end. Eyes rolling
								in fear, thebrick-maker’s draft horse looked like it was on the verge of bolting,
								thoughwhere it would go was impossible to say. The animals filled the island
								tooverflowing; they were packed shoulder to flank over the entire little circleand the
								bridge.
							</p>

							<p>
								Kip was so absorbed in the spectacle that he began floating right into themiddle of the
								river between the docks and the island.“Master, it’s so hot,” a young voice said behind
								and above Kip.Kip thrashed and turned. On the raised bank of the market circle stood
								ayoung man a little older than Kip. The young man wore only a redloincloth. His curly
								black hair and bare chest glistened with sweat. He waslooking over his shoulder,
								apparently to a man behind him. Kip could seenothing of that man, but he didn’t wait.
								Kip thought they must have heardhim when he thrashed, but apparently the roar of the
								fires drowned out thesound.
							</p>

							<p>
								Motioning to Sanson, Kip swam toward the wall. Sanson followed. Theyoung man’s master
								said something, but it was lost in the noise. Kip andSanson clung to the wall with their
								bodies pressed as close to it as theycould, looking up.“Watch this,” they heard the man
								say. A whirling lasso of fire spun intoview over their heads and then flicked forward.
								It wrapped around one postof the drawbridge and stuck there. The rest of the rope flared
								out ofexistence, but that length stayed, smoldering, little wisps of flame
								escapingagainst the wood, splinters turning black and curling back, smoking.
							</p>

							<p>
								Kip was at once horrified and captivated. In all the years he’d spenthelping Master
								Danavis, the drafter had never done anything like this.“Now you try,” the man said.For a
								moment, nothing happened. Kip looked over at Sanson. Both ofthem were stuck to the wall,
								arms spread wide to get good holds on thestone so they wouldn’t have to tread water. Kip
								had the sudden feeling thatthey’d been set up. The drafter knew they were here; he’d
								just told hisapprentice that so Kip and Sanson would stay in place. They were
								goingaround. He should swim, right now, as fast as he could.
							</p>

							<p>
								He tried to breathe deeply, swallowing on his fear. Sanson returned hisgaze, his own
								eyes worried, but not understanding what Kip was thinking.
							</p>

							<p>
								Then a wheel of flame spun out above them. The animals on the bridgeand the island
								shrieked in a hundred different ways. The wheel drew backand unraveled, becoming a whip,
								somewhat like what the master drafter hadsent out just a minute before—but much, much
								larger. This was the youth’swork?
							</p>

							<p>
								The whip snapped out, but not at the post of the drawbridge. Instead, itcracked audibly
								as it snapped on the flank of the brick-maker’s draft horse.
							</p>

							<p>
								Crazed with pain and fear, the old beast surged forward. Kip heard the boylaughing as
								the horse rammed directly into the rail of the drawbridge. Therail cracked and broke
								open. Several pigs and thin-coated sheep fell into thewater.
							</p>

							<p>
								The draft horse tried to stop, suddenly aware of the drop, but its hoovesscraped wood
								for only a moment before it plunged headfirst into the water.Water splashed all the way
								over to Kip and Sanson.“What was that?! Was that what I told you to do?” the master
								drafterdemanded.
							</p>

							<p>
								Quickly, Kip looked from the animals in the water to the bridge. Thebridge post was just
								starting to catch fire in earnest now. Once it climbed upto the drawbridge, the animals
								would go crazy, just as the horse had. Kipdidn’t think the drawbridge itself would catch
								fire quickly, but he couldn’tbe sure.
							</p>

							<p>
								If he and Sanson wanted to get out of the water market and out of theburning town, the
								fastest way was to go under the straining bridge in frontof them and directly over the
								waterfall to head downriver. The other waywould be to go the long way around the
								circular lake, exposed to the eyes ofthe drafter and his apprentice above them the whole
								time. Either way theywent, at some point they would be visible.
							</p>

							<p>
								Of the animals that had fallen into the water, the big horse was the onlygood swimmer.
								It was kicking toward the other side of the water market,away from the boy and the fire.
								The sheep were screaming, little legschurning frantically. The pigs were squealing,
								lunging at each other, biting.
							</p>

							<p>
								There was a meaty slap and a cry of pain from above the boys.“You never go beyond my
								orders, Zymun! Do you understand?!”The drafter kept yelling, but Kip stopped listening.
								The drafters weredistracted. It was now or never. Kip drew a few quick breaths, nodded
								atSanson—who looked bewildered—and launched off the wall, swimmingtoward the drawbridge.
							</p>

							<p>
								Chapter 13
							</p>

							<p>
								Gavin drafted a blue platform, thin, barely visible against the water itfloated on.“You
								did that just to make me nervous, didn’t you?” Karris asked.Gavin grinned and stepped
								onto the scull. He extended a hand to Karris,giving her a little bow. She ignored his
								hand and hopped aboard.
							</p>

							<p>
								He pulled up the keel as she landed, so the scull zipped out from underher feet. She
								yelped—and he caught her with a cushion of softer green luxinthat quickly morphed into a
								seat. He lifted the seat and placed it on the frontof the scull, then bound both of
								their packs to the scull near his feet.“Gavin, I am not going to sit while you—” She
								tried to stand, and hethrew the scull forward. With nothing to hold on to, she tumbled
								back intothe chair with another yelp. Gavin laughed. Karris was one of the bestwarriors
								the Chromeria had—and she still squeaked when surprised.
							</p>

							<p>
								She shot a look back at him, peeved and amused at once.“I thought you’d like being swept
								off your feet,” he said.“You had your chance for that,” she shot back.His grin dropped
								into the waves like so many other treasures anddisappeared.
							</p>

							<p>
								Karris looked dismayed. “Gavin, I…”“No, I deserved that. Please, go ahead and
								stand.”Sixteen years. You’d think we’d have both have moved on. Not that wehaven’t both
								tried.“Thank you,” she said, but her voice was contrite. She stood up, feetwide, knees
								slightly bent.
							</p>

							<p>
								The scull was propelled by banks of little oars jutting out from eachside. Through
								generations of study, green and blue drafters had figured outhow to use gears and wheels
								and chains to drive the oars, each draftercustomizing his craft to fit his own body so
								that he could propel it withwhatever combination of arm and leg movements he preferred,
								and makingwhatever tweaks he thought made it more efficient. Because the craft had
								solittle friction with the water, an athletic drafter could go the speed of asprinting
								man for an hour.
							</p>

							<p>
								That was fast. Very fast. But it wasn’t nearly as fast as Gavin hadpromised. Still, he
								leaned fully forward, his body suspended in a web ofluxin, arms and legs pumping. He
								elongated and narrowed the scull so itbecame a dagger knifing over the water’s face.
								They attained full speed asthey left the harbor.
							</p>

							<p>
								Gavin was sweating, but it was a good, clean feeling. The wind blew inhis face, carrying
								away any words either he or Karris might have said, andwithout words, there was simply
								her presence, the sight of her dark hairwhipping in the sea wind, the strong lines of
								her face, skin glowing in themorning light, chin lifted, neck extended, enjoying the
								freedom as much ashe was.
							</p>

							<p>
								Karris was facing forward, so she didn’t see him draft the luxin scoopsinto the water.
								Gavin had always thought there had to be a better way. Afterall, a drafter could throw a
								fireball at any speed, it was only dependent onwill—if he threw something too big or too
								fast, of course, he might hurthimself from absorbing the kick—but sculls didn’t take
								advantage of will.They were instead perfect rowing watercraft that used muscle power
								moreefficiently than any other machine. Gavin wanted to do better; he wanted touse magic
								the way a sail used wind.
							</p>

							<p>
								That had only led to ripping off a mast or two. But he refused to give up.
							</p>

							<p>
								It had been one of his seven goals when he’d still had seven years left tolive: learn to
								travel faster than anyone thinks is possible.
							</p>

							<p>
								The solution had come to him from when he was a child, shooting seedsthrough a reed at
								his brothers. Air, trapped between a plug and the walls ofthe reed, could shoot a seed
								with much greater force than if you’d simplytried to throw it with your hand. After a
								lot of trial and error, he’d put thewhole reed in the water, opening it at both ends so
								it traveled fullyunderwater. He attached another reed diagonally and shot plugs of
								magicdown into the water and then out the back of the reeds.
							</p>

							<p>
								He let the oars drop and the whole mechanism fell away with barely asplash, luxin
								dissolving even as it hit the waves. He put his hands to thereeds.
							</p>

							<p>
								At the first thump, Karris jerked. She squatted deeper to lower her centerof gravity and
								her hand went instinctively to her ataghan—except that itwas in her pack. Then the scull
								leapt forward. The first great thumps shookeverything as Gavin strained to get up to
								speed, his muscles knotting witheffort. But within moments, the scull leveled off, and
								the tension on Gavin’sarms and shoulders eased somewhat. The plugs hit the water at a
								steadywhup-whup-whup. The modified scull—what he called his skimmer—barely kissed the
								waves.
							</p>

							<p>
								There was still physical effort. Gavin was throwing a lot of force intothe water, and
								his arms and shoulders were basically lifting all of his ownweight plus Karris’s. But
								magic could be drafted from the whole body, so itwas like carrying a heavy pack with the
								straps distributing the weightperfectly—strenuous, but not crushing. Still, in the last
								year of doing thisevery day, his shoulders and arms had gotten bigger than in his entire
								life.
							</p>

							<p>
								Karris turned. Her mouth literally hung open. She stared at the entirecontraption, the
								scoops of blue luxin given flexibility throughout withgreen, with the super-flexible,
								sticky red where the plugs shot into the reedsso they wouldn’t be shattered. She
								straightened slowly, leaning into thewind, her back against Gavin so that she wasn’t
								creating another windbreak.
							</p>

							<p>
								He felt her shaking, and realized she was laughing with delight, thoughhe could barely
								hear it. The wind blew away the smell of her hair too, butfor a moment he imagined he
								could smell it again. It made him ache.“Watch this,” he shouted. In the distance, an
								island appeared. He leanedand the skimmer veered hard toward it. Indeed, he’d quickly
								learned thatthe skimmer was capable of maneuvering much faster than he could. Thereal
								limit was how quickly he could change direction without tearinghimself in half. He
								leaned right and then left, carving beautiful turns on thecalm seas. He angled the reeds
								down and the skimmer popped over one ofthe bigger waves and suddenly they were airborne.
							</p>

							<p>
								For more than a hundred paces, they flew, silent except for the sound ofthe wind, right
								over the little island. Then they landed like a skipping stoneand were off once more.
							</p>

							<p>
								In the speed and wind and the closeness of Karris, Gavin finally felt freeonce more.
								Despite the warmth of the day, the wind was cold, and if Karrisdidn’t quite burrow into
								him, she did let her body fully relax against his,grateful for his warmth. If she got
								too cold, he knew, she would draft sub-red, but she was saving her strength. She didn’t
								know what waited for her inTyrea.
							</p>

							<p>
								That he did—at least in part—lent sweetness to the moment. She wouldread the White’s
								letter and learn that he’d fathered a child while they werebetrothed. Though she now
								professed no interest in his love life, it had beenone of the questions she’d asked when
								he broke it off: Is there anotherwoman? No. Have there ever been any other women while
								we’ve beenbetrothed? No, I swear it.
							</p>

							<p>
								Karris wouldn’t forgive him this time. It had taken years for her toforgive him for
								breaking their betrothal and refusing to answer why. Butthis, this was betrayal.
							</p>

							<p>
								Orholam, how he’d miss her.He avoided the shipping lanes and stayed far from shore.
								Around noon,he saw clouds ahead. It didn’t look like a storm, so he guessed that it
								wasthe island satrapy of Ilyta. It was a country of many ports and more pirates.The
								central government had collapsed decades ago, and now parts of itwere ruled by whatever
								pirate lord was powerful at the moment. Most ofthe Seven Satrapies paid tribute to one
								or another of the pirate lords,enriching them and enabling them to do more piracy.
							</p>

							<p>
								Gavin had no fear of them, but he didn’t want to be seen either. While itmight be good
								for the pirates to have another reason to fear the Chromeria,he’d prefer to keep his
								little invention secret for as long as possible.Besides, he was only using Ilyta as a
								landmark. It was a lot of trouble to usean astrolabe, and in the time it took him to
								calculate their position he couldjust skim around until he found it. Garriston was at
								the mouth of a largeriver. It was the busiest port in Tyrea, but that wasn’t saying
								much. Heturned south.
							</p>

							<p>
								Karris said something to him, but he couldn’t hear her, so he slowed theskimmer.“Can I
								try too?” she asked.“I thought you were saving your strength.”“You can’t have all the
								fun.” Because he was behind her, he couldn’t seeher whole smile, but he saw one dimple
								and one raised eyebrow.
							</p>

							<p>
								He widened the skimmer’s hull so they could stand side by side, andhanded over the
								starboard reed. Karris always preferred to draft from herright hand.
							</p>

							<p>
								At first they were out of synch, and the craft shuddered and strained asthey threw the
								plugs at different speeds and times. He looked over at her,but before he could say
								anything she took his right hand in her left. Shesqueezed a tempo to keep him on the
								beat as she used to do when theydanced.
							</p>

							<p>
								The memory hit him as if the skimmer had clipped a reef and smashedhim into the sea:
								Karris, fifteen years old, before the war, at the yearlyLuxlords’ Ball on top of the
								Chromeria. Her light blonde hair was long andstraight and as fine and shiny as her green
								silk dress. Their fathers were indiscussion on which of the Guile brothers she would
								marry. Gavin, the elderbrother and likely to become the next Prism, was of course the
								richer prize.His father, Andross Guile, didn’t care about Karris’s beauty.“You want a
								beautiful woman? That’s what mistresses are for.” Butthough he didn’t care for the boys’
								preferences—alliances were to bebought as cheaply as possible, and the marriage of his
								firstborn was themost valuable stone he had to play—Andross Guile was well aware
								thatother families weren’t always so calculating. Some fathers were loath tomarry their
								daughters to men they didn’t care for.
							</p>

							<p>
								Andross Guile had ordered the younger Dazen to seduce Karris.“There’s a servant’s room
								one floor down. Here’s the key. Twenty minutesafter you leave with her, I’ll make some
								pretext for her father and I to speakprivately, and we’ll come down. I expect to catch
								you in the act. I’ll besurprised, dismayed, furious. I’ll most likely strike you. But
								what is one todo? The passions of youth and so forth. You understand?”
							</p>

							<p>
								Both brothers did. Luxlord Rissum White Oak was reputed to be hot-tempered. Andross
								Guile would strike Dazen first and get himself betweenthe two so White Oak didn’t try to
								kill Dazen. But the real point was that ifKarris were caught making love with Dazen, her
								father would have nochoice. So as not to shame the White Oaks, Karris would quickly
								bemarried to Dazen. The families would be allied, and Andross Guile wouldstill have his
								more valuable elder son to play.“Gavin, I expect you to be pleasant but not encouraging
								with the girl. Ifyour brother fails the family in this, you will have to marry
								her.”“Yes, sir.”But then the ball had begun. Gavin had taken the first dance with
								Karrisand the worst possible thing had happened. Holding her petite form againsthim, her
								hand in his squeezing out the beat, and looking into her jade greeneyes—at the time, she
								had had only the tiniest flecks of red in her irises—Gavin had been enchanted. By the
								time Dazen came to dance with her,Gavin was in love. Or lust anyway.
							</p>

							<p>
								I’ve been betraying Karris since before we even met.Karris squeezed his hand harder than
								she had been. He looked over. Hereyes held a question. He must have tensed, and Karris
								had caught it. She’dalways been deeply physical. She hugged or brushed or touched those
								sheloved all the time. Dancing was as natural to her as walking. She didn’ttouch Gavin
								often anymore.
							</p>

							<p>
								He gave a dismissive smile and shook his head. It’s nothing.Karris opened her mouth to
								speak, paused. “Make the tubes bigger!” sheshouted, and laughed, the barest edge on it.
								A forced laugh.
							</p>

							<p>
								So she remembered the dance, squeezing out the beat into his hand. Ofcourse she did. But
								she was letting it go, and he was grateful for it. Hewidened the reeds as far as they
								could handle, and soon they were goingfaster than he’d ever gone by himself. He hadn’t
								meant to show her thisnext trick, but he couldn’t help himself. He knew it would bring
								her realjoy. And what fun is it being a genius if no one appreciates you?
							</p>

							<p>
								He released Karris’s hand. This part was the most dangerous. At thisspeed, running into
								something deliberately was stupid. And yet…“Brace yourself!” he shouted. Throwing his
								right fist forward, Gavinthrew green luxin out as far in front of them as he could. It
								landed on thewaves with a splash. A moment later, the skimmer hit the green luxin ramp.
							</p>

							<p>
								In an instant, they were airborne. Flying, twenty paces above the waves.Gavin released
								the whole reed apparatus and drafted. The luxin of theplatform shot up his and Karris’s
								backs and then shot out from his arms.They were falling now, fifteen paces from the
								waves, and even if hittingthem at this speed meant they would skip rather than just
								splash, they werestill falling twenty paces. The luxin spun out in every color, trying
								to formdespite the gale-force wind.
							</p>

							<p>
								Ten paces to the waves. Five. At this speed, hitting the water would belike hitting
								granite.
							</p>

							<p>
								Then the luxin hardened in its shape, which was as much like a condor’swings as Gavin
								had been able to manage. The wings caught the air, andKarris and Gavin shot into the
								sky.
							</p>

							<p>
								The first time Gavin had attempted it, he’d tried to hold one wing ineach hand. He’d
								learned then why birds have hollow bones and weighalmost nothing. The lift had nearly
								torn his arms off. He’d gone home wet,bruised, and angry, with most of the muscles in
								his arms and chest torn. Bymaking the condor all one piece instead, he’d taken away the
								need formuscle at all. The whole thing flew on the strength and flexibility of theluxin,
								speed, and wind.
							</p>

							<p>
								Of course, it didn’t really fly. It glided. He’d tried to use the reeds, but ithadn’t
								worked so far. For the time being, the condor had a limited range.
							</p>

							<p>
								Karris wasn’t complaining. She was wide-eyed. “Gavin! Orholam,
							</p>

							<p>
								Gavin, we’re flying!” She laughed, carefree. He’d always loved that abouther. Her
								laughter was freedom for both of them. She’d forgotten about thedance. That made it
								worth it.“Get in the middle,” he said. He didn’t have to shout. They werecompletely
								inside the body of the condor. There was no wind. “I’m not verygood at turning; mostly I
								lean one way or the other.” Indeed, because hewas heavier, they were already turning
								toward his side. Together, theyleaned toward her side until the condor straightened.“The
								White doesn’t know about this, does she?” Karris asked.“Only you,” he said.
								“Besides…”“No one else could do the drafting required,” Karris finished for him.“Galib
								and Tarkian are probably the only polychromes who couldhandle all the colors necessary,
								and neither of them is fast enough. If I canmake it easy enough for other drafters, I
								might tell her.”“Might?”“I’ve been thinking about the ways this could be used. In war,
								mostly.
							</p>

							<p>
								The Seven Satrapies already fight and scheme over the few polychromesthere are. This
								would make it a hundred times worse.”“Is that Garriston?” she said abruptly, looking
								north and west.“Already?”“The real question is whether you want to crash onto land or
								into thewater,” Gavin said.“Crash?”“I’m not very good at landing yet, and with so much
								extra weight—”“Excuse me?” Karris said.“What? I haven’t tried flying with a manatee
								aboard either, I’m just—”“You did not just compare me to a sea cow.” Her expression made
								icelook warm.“No! It’s just that all the extra weight…” What is it you’re supposed todo
								when you’re in a hole? Oh. “Um.” He cleared his throat.
							</p>

							<p>
								She grinned suddenly, dimples flashing. “After all this time, Gavin, Istill get you.”
								She laughed.
							</p>

							<p>
								He laughed ruefully, but the pain went deep. And I still don’t get you.
							</p>

							<p>
								Maybe she would have been happy with Dazen.
							</p>

							<p>
								Chapter 14
							</p>

							<p>
								It felt like years before Kip reached the bridge post. He paused, lookingback toward the
								drafters as Sanson caught up with him. The master was stillstriking his apprentice,
								who’d curled into a ball, screaming. They definitelyhadn’t seen Kip or Sanson, but they
								were also turned toward them, and ifthey looked up, the bridge post wasn’t big enough to
								hide both boys.
							</p>

							<p>
								The bridge groaned, and Kip looked up. The opposite post, on the islandside, was aflame,
								and the animals were pushing away from it, but too scaredto go back into town, which was
								also burning. That pushed them against therail directly above the boys—and against the
								gap in the rail the horse hadmade—mere paces to their left.
							</p>

							<p>
								Half a dozen rats splashed into the water, kicked by the other animals.
							</p>

							<p>
								Each of them began swimming in a different direction, including severalright at the
								boys.
							</p>

							<p>
								Kip’s stomach knotted in visceral fear. It was ridiculous that a rat shouldfreeze him
								while two drafters didn’t—but he hated rats. Hated hated hatedthem. Sanson yanked on his
								sleeve, pulling him away. Kip launched off thepost, splashing awkwardly. He turned back,
								making sure none of the ratslatched onto his clothes. His eyes flicked up to the
								apprentice drafterZymun, the boy’s head tucked between his arms as his master beat him.
								Butthen Zymun stiffened.
							</p>

							<p>
								Zymun shouted something and stood, and his master stopped hittinghim. Kip got his first
								good look at the boy. He couldn’t have been morethan a year older than Kip, with unruly
								black hair, dark eyes, and a wide,fleshy mouth curved into a triumphant grin. Even in
								the moment Kip sawhim, Zymun’s and his master’s skin were filling with red, the swirls
								likesmoke being inhaled, but then compacted until it filled their bodies.
							</p>

							<p>
								Kip turned and swam as hard as he could. There was one metal screen infront of the
								waterfall to keep boats or swimmers from going over, and adock and stairs next to it.
								Sanson was already to the screen, more than tenpaces ahead of Kip.
							</p>

							<p>
								After a few more hard strokes, Kip glanced back. The bridge and thejostling animals
								blocked much of his view of the two drafters, but as helooked, he saw the master run a
								few quick steps forward. He jumped,spread his arms wide, and slapped his hands together.
								A shimmering ball ofred luxin formed between his hands, and as they slapped together
								itrocketed forward. The drafter was blasted back by the force of what he’dthrown, but
								still landed on his feet.
							</p>

							<p>
								The ball caught fire in midair, right before it plowed through the animalson the bridge.
								Sheep, horses, and pigs exploded in every direction, bodyparts flying. Wild shrieks
								filled the air, sounding almost human. Theburning missile tore off the railing and
								blasted a chunk out of the middle ofthe bridge itself, and then it streaked over Kip’s
								head with a fiery roar andsmashed the wood stairs above the dock. Kip didn’t think the
								drafter hadmissed, and for a moment he thought the man was trying to trap them.
							</p>

							<p>
								The drawbridge cracked, and all the animals on it stumbled toward thesagging middle.
							</p>

							<p>
								Now Zymun ran forward. He slapped red hand to red hand, but this time
							</p>

							<p>
								Kip couldn’t even see the ball of luxin—because it wasn’t aimed at him.One moment, Zymun
								was falling back, completely bowled over from theforce of what he had thrown, and the
								next, the entire wood bridge exploded.
							</p>

							<p>
								Flames and blood and spinning, detached body parts leapt into the sky.
							</p>

							<p>
								One great flaming section of the bridge streaked toward Kip, tumbling andfilling his
								vision. It hit the water beside him with a great hissing splash.
							</p>

							<p>
								When Kip could see again, he was pressed against the metal screen infront of the
								waterfall, surrounded by scraps and shards of wood, somesections still burning, one
								great section of the bridge slowly sinking, andhundreds of rats, some burnt to charcoal,
								others wounded, others simplywet, but all the living desperate to get out of the water.
								The larger animalshadn’t been blown so far by the explosion, but they were coming,
								thrashing,kicking, splashing, biting each other in their fear and pain.“Kip! Climb over!
								We’ve almost made it!” Sanson shouted. He wasalready on the other side of the metal
								screen.“Don’t move!” the older drafter shouted. His skin was already fillingwith red
								swirls. “Don’t move or the next one’s coming for your head!”
							</p>

							<p>
								Kip grabbed the screen, but as soon as his hands touched it, he felt littleclaws
								scratching on his legs, then more on his back. He froze. Rats. Firstone or two, then
								half a dozen.
							</p>

							<p>
								His eyes clamped shut as he felt the claws scramble onto his neck, andthen over his
								head. In holding on to the screen, his body had become abridge—the only way out of the
								water—and the rats swarmed him.
							</p>

							<p>
								In moments, it wasn’t half a dozen rats. It was hundreds.Kip’s muscles locked. He
								couldn’t move. Couldn’t think. Couldn’tbreathe. He didn’t dare even open his eyes. Rats
								were in his hair. A rat hadfallen down the front of his shirt and was clawing his chest.
								Rats wererunning up his arms.“Move, Kip! Move or die!” Sanson shouted.Suddenly, Kip felt
								detached from his own body. He was nearlydrowning, the town was on fire, almost everyone
								he knew was dead, twodrafters were trying to kill him, and he was worried about rats.
								Even as heclung here, the drafters were preparing the death blow, and he was
								toofrightened to move. Ridiculous. Pathetic.
							</p>

							<p>
								He felt a hand grab him, and his eyes snapped open. It was Sanson.
							</p>

							<p>
								Sanson had climbed back up the grate and was braving the rats to try to helpKip over.
								Kip shook like a dog, dislodging perhaps a dozen rats, but leavingmany more. Still
								terrified, he began climbing up the grate.
							</p>

							<p>
								He threw one leg up onto the top of the grate, but he couldn’t pullhimself up. He was
								too heavy. A rat fell into his gaping pant leg and beganscurrying up against his bare
								skin.
							</p>

							<p>
								Sanson grabbed Kip’s clothes with both hands and yelled with the effort.
							</p>

							<p>
								Kip pulled one last time, and felt his body rising, rising—and finally rollingover the
								top of the grate. He crashed into the water on the other side.
							</p>

							<p>
								The current pulled at him immediately. When he surfaced, Sanson wasyelling something,
								but Kip couldn’t even make out the words. He reacheddown into his pants and grabbed the
								struggling rat and threw it away.
							</p>

							<p>
								Then he was at the waterfall. There were ledges running perpendicularto the falls, and
								the town daredevils would sprint along those and leap overthe falls. It was too late for
								Kip to try that. There were sections where thewater was shallower than others. Kip
								turned desperately and his feet caughtan underwater rock. The force of the current
								pushed him forward, and hesquatted on the rock, gathering his feet underneath him,
								flailing his hands toright himself. The pool at the base of the falls was plenty deep,
								but if hedidn’t jump far enough, he’d hit rocks on his way down.
							</p>

							<p>
								He jumped as hard as he could. To his surprise, he actually went thedirection he was
								trying. For a moment, there was perfect freedom. Peace.The roar of the water drowned out
								all other sound, all other thought. It wasbeautiful. Somehow, he and Sanson had been
								floating in the river all night,and now the sun was just peeking above the horizon,
								beating back themidnight black of one horizon to deep blue, to icy blue, to pinks
								andoranges that lit clouds like halos.
							</p>

							<p>
								Then Kip realized how fast he was falling. His body was at an angle tothe
								fast-approaching water below. From watching the bolder youths, heknew he had to hit feet
								first or headfirst with arms extended or he would behurt badly.
							</p>

							<p>
								There was no way he was going headfirst, so he arched his back andwheeled his arms.
							</p>

							<p>
								Whatever he’d done, it seemed to be the exact wrong thing, or maybehe’d already been
								twisting forward, because he found himself parallel to thewater. He was going to land
								the most colossal bellyflop ever seen. From thisheight, it might well kill him.
							</p>

							<p>
								Not only that, but he realized that he was falling with the water—all thedivers he’d
								ever seen had jumped out beyond it. The water always glancedoff one rock on the way
								down.
							</p>

							<p>
								He didn’t even have time to think a curse before a rock smacked hisfoot, hard. He threw
								his arms out——as he crashed into the water headfirst, feeling like someone had justhit
								him over the top of the head with a board. His arms felt like they’d beentorn off. And
								he’d forgotten to take a breath before he hit. Kip opened hiseyes underwater in time to
								see something big streak down into the waterbeside him in a gush of bubbles. Sanson!
							</p>

							<p>
								Sanson had hit feet first, but had been spun when he hit the water so hewas upside down.
								He seemed stunned for a moment, unmoving, then hiseyes opened, but he was looking away
								from Kip. Obviously disorientedfrom the fall, Sanson began swimming—down. Kip grabbed
								his foot to gethis attention.
							</p>

							<p>
								But Sanson panicked. He thrashed and kicked Kip square in the nose.
							</p>

							<p>
								Kip yelled—and watched the last of his air go rushing toward the surface.
							</p>

							<p>
								Sanson turned, saw Kip, saw the direction the bubbles were going, andthen saw the blood
								blossoming in the dark water. He grabbed Kip, andtogether the boys swam for the surface.
							</p>

							<p>
								Kip barely made it. He gasped, inhaling water and blood, and thencoughed it out. He
								coughed again, then retched. Sanson tugged on his arm.“Kip, help me! We’ve got to get to
								shore before we get to the rapids.”
							</p>

							<p>
								That woke Kip up. Within fifty paces of the deep, still area where thewaterfall landed,
								there was another set of rapids so steep they were almost aseries of waterfalls
								themselves. And already the current was getting swifter.Foot aching, head splitting,
								nose streaming blood, he swam with Sanson.
							</p>

							<p>
								They made it to shore with ten paces to spare. The boys hauledthemselves onto a grassy
								bank and inspected the damage, exhausted.Sanson was uninjured, and he looked sheepish.
								“Sorry, Kip. I mean, aboutyour nose and all. I never liked swimming. Always thought
								there werethings in the deep that’d grab me.”
							</p>

							<p>
								Pinching his bleeding nose, Kip looked at his friend. “Oo sabed my lifeub dere,” he
								said. “Oo din’t eben break ma nose.” Kip was more concernedabout the foot he’d struck on
								his way down. He unlaced his shoe with onehand and tugged the shoe and stocking off. His
								foot was sore, and therewere some nice scrapes along the top, but when he rubbed it he
								didn’t thinkany bones were broken. He began tugging his wet stocking back on, whichwas
								hard to do while still pinching his nose with one hand.“I can’t believe we got—” Sanson
								started.“Away?” Kip asked. He had abandoned trying to tie his shoe with onehand and was
								sniffing hard, trying to keep blood from dripping all overhim. Even as he finished the
								knot, though, he knew why Sanson hadstopped speaking. They were bathed in a harsh red
								glare.
							</p>

							<p>
								Looking up, Kip saw a red flare hanging in the sky above them, markingtheir location for
								the rest of the king’s army—who had to be nearby. Theflare’s smoke trail led back to the
								top of the falls, where the two draftersstood, looking at them.
							</p>

							<p>
								Kip and Sanson had escaped two drafters. Now they had to escape therest of the army.
							</p>

							<p>
								Kip hopped to his feet, sniffing hard. He thought he was going tohyperventilate. Then he
								saw a horseman on the ridge that wound fromabove the waterfall down to the Sendinas’
								farm. He abruptly forgot abouthis bleeding nose. The horseman would have to go farther
								to go around, buthe had a horse. Kip and Sanson had to make it down the trail along
								therapids and get to the farm before the horseman did.
							</p>

							<p>
								Then Kip saw three other horsemen join the first. And then another, andanother.
							</p>

							<p>
								He and Sanson started running.The waterfall kicked up huge clouds of mist, day and
								night, and thevalley stayed dark for hours longer than the surrounding country. When
								theflare winked out, Kip lost sight of both the horsemen and the trail.
							</p>

							<p>
								He stopped, terrified. Broad-leafed plants, slick with the mist, obscuredboth sides of
								the tiny trail. One foot set on those, and he would plungedown the rocky incline to the
								river. In the rapids, he’d be battered to death.
							</p>

							<p>
								He needed to see. He tried to look at things out of the corners of hiseyes, the way
								Master Danavis had taught him. The part of your eye thatfocused on things was best at
								seeing colors, but outside the focus area wasbetter at seeing light and dark.“Move!”
								Sanson said.Kip looked over his shoulder. Sanson’s face looked like it was on fire.
							</p>

							<p>
								Kip took a step back and tottered on the sharp edge of the trail. EverywhereSanson’s
								skin was exposed, he looked hot. Kip could even see the steamevaporating off his arms in
								little orange whorls.“What’s wrong with your eyes?” Sanson asked. “Never mind. Move,
							</p>

							<p>
								Kip!”
							</p>

							<p>
								Sanson was right again. It didn’t matter what Kip was seeing, or how.
							</p>

							<p>
								He turned and started forward. Somehow, the wonder of it all crowded outhis fear. The
								plants were like torches lighting his way, even gentlyilluminating the trail between.
							</p>

							<p>
								One hand still hitching up his wet, heavy pants, Kip began jogging asfast as he could,
								fearless despite the slick rocks, narrow trail, and deathbeckoning from every side.
							</p>

							<p>
								There were bodies in the river, caught up in the rapids. Dear Orholam,there were bodies
								at the Sendinas’ farm, little lumps nearly as cold as thesurrounding ground. Smoldering,
								ruined buildings burned hot in Kip’svision. More important for him and Sanson, he saw a
								flat-bottomed punttied at the Sendinas’ dock. He and Sanson hit the bottom of the trail
								at a fullrun. They rounded a corner and in the morning sun saw thirty mountedMirrormen,
								drawn up in battle formation.“We wanted to take you alive,” the red drafter said. His
								skin wascrimson, and fury tinged his voice. “A drafter with your potential doesn’tcome
								along every day. But you’ve killed two of King Garadul’s men, andfor that, you die.”
							</p>

							<p>
								Chapter 15“You’re not really going to crash us,” Karris said as Gavin brought themover
								the scrub desert.“Oh, I see. When I’m flying, we’re flying, but when we’re crashing,
								I’mcrashing.”
							</p>

							<p>
								Gavin banked the condor to the right so they wouldn’t be seen from
							</p>

							<p>
								Garriston. There was still a good chance some farmer or fisherman wouldspot them, but
								who would believe a lone fisherman who said he’d seen agiant flying man-bird? If a whole
								city saw them, it would be a differentstory. Garriston, despite being the most important
								port in Tyrea, wasn’tmuch. The bay was overfished, the land was hot and dry with bad
								soil, theRuthgari governor corrupt, his men worse.
							</p>

							<p>
								It hadn’t always been this way. Before the False Prism’s War, there hadbeen a vast
								system of irrigation canals that had brought this scrub desertinto bloom, with two or
								even three harvests a year. There had been locksthat fed trade to dozens of small cities
								up and down the Umber River. Butcanals and locks required drafters and maintenance.
								Without either, thisland had withered, punished for the sins of dead men.“Gavin, I’m
								serious. Are we really going to crash?”“Trust me,” he said.She opened her mouth, then
								shut it. He guessed what she hadn’t said:
							</p>

							<p>
								Because that’s worked out so well for me before?“Got anything fragile in your bag?” he
								asked.“How bad is this going to be?” she asked, real concern in her voice.“Sorry. I
								should have waited until we were closer to the ground.”“Wait, what’s that?” Karris
								asked.
							</p>

							<p>
								Gavin looked west, following her eyes, but didn’t see what had madeher curious. The land
								around Garriston was plains and dry farmland, but tothe west it quickly yielded to
								steep, tall, impassable mountains that abuttedalmost directly on the sea. The Umber
								River was just on the other side ofthose mountains. If it could go straight to the
								sea—through the mountains—it would have been only ten leagues long. Instead, it had to
								go east toGarriston, separated from the ocean by fencelike mountains, almost ahundred
								and fifty leagues from origin to outlet.“There,” Karris said, pointing. “Smoke.”Gavin
								wasn’t sure that the black wisp was anything more than Karris’s—and now his—imagination.
								Regardless, it was on the other side of themountains, so it didn’t matter. He was just
								opening his mouth to tell Karristhat when the condor passed over one of the foothills. A
								powerful updraftshot them higher into the air.
							</p>

							<p>
								It took Gavin’s breath away. He’d only experimented with the condorover water. He hadn’t
								even thought about how the ground beneath where hewas gliding would affect the air above
								it. Now that he had experienced it, itmade sense. Why else did birds of prey spiral so
								often in the same places?Gavin had assumed they were good hunting grounds. Now he
								knew.Updrafts.“Can we make it over the mountains?” Karris asked.From this new
								height—Gavin looked down, gulped, and immediatelylooked back to the horizon—he was
								certain that what they had seen wassmoke. And for it to be visible from this far away,
								it could only be one oftwo things.
							</p>

							<p>
								Let it be a forest fire. Please, Orholam.“We can. But if we do, you’re not going to meet
								the man who wassupposed to get you into Garadul’s army. And I can’t get the condor
								backinto the air without the sea. I’ll have to float all the way down the river.”“Gavin,
								when I see that much smoke, I think red wight. A Torch couldbe burning down an entire
								city. You’re heading out to stop a color wightnear Ru? These people aren’t worth any
								less than the people of Ru. If itcomes to it, there are a lot of drafters in Ru who
								could work togetheragainst the blue wight. These people have no one.”
							</p>

							<p>
								In his mind’s eye, Gavin was comparing the land below him to the mapshe knew of Tyrea.
								It was surprisingly easy, given that he was closer to theperspective most maps were
								drawn from than most people ever got. Helooked at the mountains, the not-quite-pass
								through them, and the positionof the rising smoke. A thought struck him with a greater
								force than mereintuition. He wasn’t here on accident. It wasn’t coincidence that he
								wasgliding in the one place where he could see this fire, or that he had Karriswith him.
								That was no forest fire. It wasn’t a red wight either.
							</p>

							<p>
								That fire was rising from Rekton. It had been a beautiful town before thewar. It was the
								town where Gavin’s “son” was. Gavin knew it, even thoughthey were so far away there was
								no way to know it. If Orholam had actuallyexisted, this was the kind of punishment he
								would devise for Gavin. Or test.
							</p>

							<p>
								Whatever it was, it was a choice.Five years left, and five great purposes still to
								accomplish. And one ofthose actually was mostly selfless: to free Garriston, which had
								beencrushed because of him. Which was suffering still, because of him.
							</p>

							<p>
								If Gavin went to Rekton, he’d have to face that crazy woman, Lina.
							</p>

							<p>
								He’d have to face her son Kip, and tell him that he wasn’t his father: Sorry,you’re
								still fatherless. I have no idea what your lying slut mother is talkingabout.
							</p>

							<p>
								That would doubtless go over well. They would also be close to Rask
							</p>

							<p>
								Garadul’s army, so Karris would open her orders, and everything would getmessy fast.
							</p>

							<p>
								All Gavin had to say was, “I’ve got my orders.” Karris wouldunderstand. She’d always
								been dutiful. To a fault.
							</p>

							<p>
								But you aren’t Karris. This isn’t her test.He opened his mouth to say it, and it tasted
								like cowardice. He couldn’tforce the words past his gritted teeth.“Let’s go see,” Gavin
								said. He banked the condor, and saw that hehadn’t made his decision a moment too soon.
								It would be a near thing toclear the gap between the mountains.
							</p>

							<p>
								Karris squeezed his hand and her eyes sparkled, those jade green eyeswith red diamonds
								in them. For some reason, her joy struck him moredeeply than any disappointment could
								have. That joy was a reminder ofsixteen years of joy he should have given her, joy
								stolen. He turned away,his throat tight.
							</p>

							<p>
								The mountains loomed, and Gavin realized for the first time just howfast they were
								going. There was no hope of a splashing wet landing here. Ifthe updrafts he’d expected
								didn’t catch them soon, he and Karris weregoing to paint a large crimson blotch across
								the face of these rocks.
							</p>

							<p>
								Orholam, if there isn’t any wind at all, then there isn’t any wind to getthrown upward,
								is there?
							</p>

							<p>
								He was beginning to draft a red cushion—hopelessly, knowing no matterhow big he made it,
								it would be too little at this speed—when the updraftcaught them. They were hurled
								skyward, the wings of the condor straining.
							</p>

							<p>
								Karris shouted with exultation.The force was incredible. It was hard to estimate how
								fast they wererising, but Gavin shortened the condor’s wings both to take stress off
								themand because Rekton wasn’t so far away that they would need that muchheight. The
								higher they were, the more visible they were. But it did makehim think. With all the
								height he could get off of mountains, the condor’srange was vastly greater than he had
								assumed.
							</p>

							<p>
								It was a thought for another time. Right now the problem was to staylow so they weren’t
								visible to all of Tyrea, and to lose some of thetremendous speed they’d built up. He
								drafted a bonnet the same blue luxinhe’d used for himself when he jumped from the
								Chromeria. It popped openinstantly, throwing both him and Karris forward, then ripped
								away almostas fast.
							</p>

							<p>
								When they regained their balance, Gavin tried again. Green this time,and much smaller.
								He sealed the bonnet to the luxin of the condor so itdidn’t tear him apart. It worked,
								sort of. They slowed a little. Now theywere headed downward at merely ridiculous speeds.
								Gavin struggled toexpand the wingspan again.“What can I do?” Karris shouted.Gavin
								cursed. He’d barely begun to experiment with changing thecondor’s wings. In all his
								trials, he’d merely leaned to one side or the otherand caught himself before hitting the
								ground or the water. Grunting with thestrain, he lifted the front edge of the wings
								skyward. Point up to go up,right?
							</p>

							<p>
								It was exactly the wrong thing to do. They pitched sharply downward.
							</p>

							<p>
								By the time he leveled off the wings, they were heading straight down.Worse, the
								suddenness of their drop meant his feet weren’t even touchingthe floor. He had no
								leverage to push against to continue to manipulate thewings. He threw luxin up to the
								ceiling to force his body down, and beganlocking his feet to the floor, but the
								eucalyptus trees were looming huge. Hewas too slow.
							</p>

							<p>
								Then he was slammed to the floor. The condor dipped below the heightof the trees, in a
								meadow, and then began to rise. It wasn’t going to make it.
							</p>

							<p>
								Gavin reached into the luxin as the condor crashed through the branches.
							</p>

							<p>
								The blue luxin cracked and would have shattered if he hadn’t grabbed it.For another
								instant, he couldn’t see anything as they knifed through thetrees, then again they were
								airborne. Heading up and up, steeper andsteeper.
							</p>

							<p>
								He finally looked at Karris. Her skin was a war of green and red. Herhands were braced
								against the ceiling and the luxin lines traced from bothhands to the back of the condor.
								She’d taken control of the tail. It wasflared, green, bent up. She’d saved their lives,
								but her eyes were closed withthe effort, muscles straining to hold the tail up against
								the force of the wind.“Karris, level it off!” Gavin shouted.“I’m trying!”“You’ve already
								gone too—”Then they were upside down, heading back the opposite direction.
							</p>

							<p>
								Gavin’s shirt fell in front of his face, and when he pulled it out of the waythey were
								leveled off—upside down.“Don’t level off now!”“Make up your mind!” she shouted. She was
								standing on her hands onthe ceiling. Gavin locked her in again and together they turned
								the wingsand tail once more. They were crushed to the floor as the great luxin
								birdswooped out level once more, only twenty paces above the trees.
							</p>

							<p>
								Gavin breathed freely for the first time in what seemed like hours. Hechecked the
								condor. It seemed well enough.“Did they see us?” Karris asked.“What? Who?” How was she
								able to see so many things at once?“Them,” she said, nodding.Gavin looked toward Rekton.
								They were only a few leagues east of thetown now, and it had indeed been burned. All of
								it. That meant either anincredibly strong red wight, or something else entirely.
							</p>

							<p>
								And they were looking at the something else. There was a small armyencamped around the
								town. It could only be Garadul’s men.
							</p>

							<p>
								Orholam have mercy.“No,” Gavin said. “They’d have to stare almost straight into the sun
								tosee us.”“Huh. Lucky, I guess,” Karris said.“You call this lucky?” Gavin asked.“What’s
								that?” she interrupted.Below the town, after the falls fed into rapids and the Umber
								River’srage finally cooled, there was a group of homes. Almost a village, but allthe
								building were smoldering. There was a green drafter, skin filling withpower, facing
								several of King Garadul’s Mirrormen.“That’s a child!” Karris said. “Two! Gavin, we’ve
								got to save them.”“I’ll bring us down as close as I can. Roll when we hit.” They
								leveledoff ten paces above a plain of rock and brush and tumbleweeds. Gavinthrew out a
								small bonnet to slow the condor again. It snapped open, but thistime they were both
								ready for the whiplash and braced themselves. Gavinthrew out another and another. They
								slowed down faster than he’dexpected. The condor pitched toward the ground.
							</p>

							<p>
								Gavin flung his hands out, blasting the condor to pieces. As they fell, hewrapped Karris
								and then himself in an enormous cushion of orange luxin,rimmed with a shell of segmented
								flexible green, with a core of super-hardyellow.
							</p>

							<p>
								They slammed into the ground, the orange and green luxin slowing thembefore exploding
								from the force of their landing. The yellow luxin wasformed into a more rigid ball
								around each of them. Gavin crashed throughsome bushes, bouncing and rolling half a dozen
								times before the yellowluxin cracked and spilled him unceremoniously onto the ground.
								Hewiggled his fingers and toes. Everything worked. He jumped up.“Karris?”He heard a
								yell. Not a good one. He ran.Karris sprang to her feet, twenty paces away. Her hair was
								askew, but hedidn’t see any obvious injuries. He came to stand by her. “What is it?”
								heasked.
							</p>

							<p>
								She glanced down. There was a rattlesnake at her feet, as long as
							</p>

							<p>
								Gavin’s spread arms. A dagger through its head pinned it to the ground.Karris’s dagger.
							</p>

							<p>
								As Gavin stood there, mouth open, Karris put a foot behind the snake’shead and pulled
								the dagger out—with her hand, for Orholam’s sake, notwith drafting. Sometimes Gavin
								forgot how tough Karris was. She wipedthe blood off on a black kerchief the Blackguards
								carried for such purposes—black didn’t show hard-to-explain bloodstains. She shook
								slightly as shetucked the kerchief away, but Gavin knew it wasn’t fear or nerves. It
								took abody time to relax from the amount of adrenaline imminent death triggered.
							</p>

							<p>
								Karris didn’t blame him for nearly getting her killed. She grabbed herbag and bowcase,
								strapped her ataghan belt around her narrow waist,checked to make sure neither blade nor
								scabbard had been damaged in thefall, and threw her bag on her back. It was like the
								sudden violence hadreminded her of what she was—and of what they weren’t. Back on
								theground, back to reality.“Sorry ’bout that,” Gavin said. “I should have gone for the
								sea.”“If we had, there could have been sharks.” She shrugged. “And now I’dbe wet.” She
								smirked, but it didn’t touch her eyes. He wasn’t going to reachher now. Work loomed—and
								her work was dangerous, a job that might welllead to war, a job that might require her
								to kill or to die. She had toruthlessly cut away any entanglements that would distract
								her.“Karris,” he said. “What’s in that note… it isn’t true. I don’t expect youto
								understand or maybe even believe me, but I swear it isn’t true.”
							</p>

							<p>
								She looked at him, hard, inscrutable. Her irises were jade green, but nowthe flecks of
								red were like starbursts, flaring, diamond-shaped. One way oranother, through means
								magical or mundane, luxin or tears, Gavin knewthat soon those eyes would be red. “Let’s
								save those children,” she said.
							</p>

							<p>
								Karris ran, and he followed her. They cut back and forth down a hillsidedominated by
								eucalyptus trees, peeling bark scattered on the ground, brushslapping them. Karris cut
								toward the skinny child, leaving Gavin to save theone facing the red drafter.
							</p>

							<p>
								But it didn’t matter. Neither of them was going to make it in time.
							</p>

							<p>
								Chapter 16
							</p>

							<p>
								It was too far to run for the punt, even for Sanson. A cool realization settledon Kip:
								he was going to die. He was surprised at his own reaction. Nopanic. No fear. Just quiet
								fury. Thirty elite Mirrormen in full harness againsta child. A trained red drafter
								against a child who’d first drafted yesterday.“When I tell you, run,” Kip told
								Sanson.Out of the corner of his eye, he saw something flash over the treeshundreds of
								paces to his left, but when he looked, there was nothing there.He saw that the Mirrormen
								were looking back and forth at each other, as ifthey’d caught the same glimpse he
								had.“Now, Sanson. Run.” Kip didn’t take his eyes off the drafter.Sanson ran.The
								Mirrormen hesitated until the red drafter gestured, a quick sign,with military
								efficiency. One Mirrorman from each side of the line peeledoff and circled around Kip,
								digging their heels hard into their horses. Thered drafter himself rode forward alone.
							</p>

							<p>
								Everything Kip had done with magic so far had been instinctive. Nowhe needed to do
								something on purpose. Light was pouring over him. Therewas green everywhere. The two
								Mirrormen circling him were each keepingan eye on him, but they were going after Sanson.
								The wildness surgedthrough Kip once again and he felt the skin under his fingernails
								tear openagain as luxin poured into his palm. A javelin formed in his hand. He hurledit
								at the Mirrorman nearer to Sanson, but the throw was pathetic. It flewmaybe fifteen
								paces, not even half the distance it needed.
							</p>

							<p>
								The red drafter laughed. Kip ignored him.
							</p>

							<p>
								Kip had seen the other red drafter and his apprentice Zymun throwfireballs from a
								standstill. They’d been thrown back from hurling somethingwith so much force, but they
								hadn’t fully thrown it physically. Kip imaginedthe magic streaking from him as the reds’
								had done. The air in front of himcoalesced, sparkling, coruscating greens, from sea-foam
								to mint toevergreen, taking on the outline of a spearhead.
							</p>

							<p>
								With an explosion of energy, it leapt away. Kip felt as if he had fired anovercharged
								musket. He tumbled to the ground. Worse, he missed. Thegreen spear cut the air behind
								the galloping Mirrorman. It crashed into oneof the few standing walls of one of the
								burned-out homes. The wall wentdown in billows of ash.
							</p>

							<p>
								Kip scrambled to his feet to try again, but even as the air begansparkling green in
								front of him, he caught something red out of the cornerof his eye. He turned toward the
								red drafter—too slowly. Something hotblasted through his hands, scattering the green
								luxin he’d been gathering,burning him.
							</p>

							<p>
								The red drafter was advancing toward him, dismounted now, walkingcalmly, red swirling
								down into his hands again. Kip held his hands up, justas he had a hundred times when Ram
								was threatening to hit him. This time,a green shield formed, translucent, covering him
								from head to toe, itsweight supported on the ground.
							</p>

							<p>
								The red drafter flicked a finger forward. A spark shot out, trailing a longred tail. It
								stuck to Kip’s shield, burning faintly, its red trail going all theway back to the
								drafter. Kip panicked and, only carrying the shield becauseit was stuck to his arms,
								dodged to one side. A much larger red missileroared out from the red drafter. It
								followed the tail toward the spark, curvingin midair along that line.
							</p>

							<p>
								Kip was blown off his feet and thrown back a dozen feet. He felt thegreen shield crack
								with a report, as if it had been his own bones snapping.
							</p>

							<p>
								He lifted himself from the dirt in time to see one of the Mirrormenpursuing Sanson raise
								his long, sweeping cavalry sword and slashdownward in midcharge. Kip couldn’t see
								Sanson, but the Mirrormenreined in and the second horseman reversed his grip on his
								lance andstabbed downward hard, once, twice, professionally, coolly.
							</p>

							<p>
								Both Mirrormen relaxed like men who’ve finished their work, and Kipknew Sanson was dead.
							</p>

							<p>
								He rolled over. The red drafter was standing over him. Kip was faintlysurprised by how
								ordinary the man looked. A long face, dark eyes, roughlycut hair, crooked teeth revealed
								by his grimace. He was going to kill Kip,but without passion. Just a man following
								orders.
							</p>

							<p>
								Before Kip could gather magic one more time, the drafter imprisoned
							</p>

							<p>
								Kip’s arms in red sludge, sticky and thick. Kip couldn’t move.
							</p>

							<p>
								The drafter raised his bespectacled eyes toward the sun once more,magic spiraling like
								smoke down into his arms, filling him with power forthe killing blow. A dense indigo dot
								appeared on his ear, then over histemple as his head moved, as if someone with a lantern
								letting out a singleray of light from somewhere in the forest was somehow focusing that
								littlebeam right on his—
							</p>

							<p>
								There was a roar, for just a fraction of a second, as if Kip were standingat the base of
								the waterfall once again. Something huge and yellow blastedinto the red drafter so fast
								and hard it seemed the man disappeared. Hisbody was thrown into the air, torn in half by
								the force of the collision. Thered luxin sludge holding Kip fell into dust.
							</p>

							<p>
								Kip stood and looked in horror at what had been a man. The red of thedrafter’s clothes
								now mingled with his blood, magic and violence mixed.But his entire upper body had been
								reduced to jelly. Kip looked to theforest.
							</p>

							<p>
								With the boy saved for the moment, Gavin ran toward the Mirrormen.Karris had headed down
								the hill to save the other boy running for the river,but she was already too late. The
								Mirrormen formed up with surprisingdiscipline and speed. None of these men had bothered
								to bard their horses.Barding was heavy and awkward and tired the horses quickly, and
								theMirrormen obviously hadn’t expected to run into any real opposition, muchless
								drafters. That meant the horses were easily the most vulnerable targets.But Gavin didn’t
								like killing innocent beasts. Their masters? That was adifferent matter.
							</p>

							<p>
								He swept a hand in a sharp, hard arc, the air crackling like a successionof rocks
								exploding in a fire. A dozen blue globes, each half the size of hisfist, shot out. The
								mirrored armor, working like a mirror reflecting light,reflected part of any luxin
								thrown against it, making it unravel. That was abig problem for a drafter trying to cut
								down a horseman with a luxin sword,but it was only protection, not invulnerability. The
								thin-walled luxin globessmashed against mirror armor—and sheared open, dumping out
								flaming redgoo that splashed all over the Mirrormen, up and down their chests, intotheir
								visors, down the seams into their groins.
							</p>

							<p>
								With fire and screams and the sizzle of burning skin, the charge faltered.
							</p>

							<p>
								Gavin swept his other hand out and another dozen globes shot out. Menwere crashing to
								the ground from their saddles, trying to roll and put out thefires. Others clawed at
								their flaming helmets, cooking. Still others weretrying to continue the charge, half a
								dozen men lowering their lances—untilthe second wave of globes caught them.
							</p>

							<p>
								More than a dozen horses continued the charge, though. Even withouttheir riders’
								guidance, these horses were bred to war, and they ran towardGavin.
							</p>

							<p>
								Gavin threw green wedges around himself like a clamshell and bracedhimself. The horses
								jostled him hard as they charged past, but left himstanding.
							</p>

							<p>
								There were only three Mirrormen left uninjured, all of them men on theends of the line
								who’d broken off the charge early. They were sawing theirreins, turning tail to flee.
								Cowards, perhaps. But smart cowards. Gavinflicked fingers at each in turn. Superviolet
								luxin was fast, light, andinvisible to almost everyone. Like a spider, each dot stuck to
								one of the menand then climbed up to the joint in their armor at the back of their
								necks.
							</p>

							<p>
								Three spiked missiles of yellow luxin sped along the supervioletspiderwebs trailing from
								those spiders to Gavin a moment later. With ameaty crunch, each missile punched through
								mail and into a spine. Threeriders toppled from their galloping horses.
							</p>

							<p>
								With all the riders around him dead or dying, Gavin looked down thehill to see how
								Karris was doing against the last two Mirrormen. One wasalready down, and if anything,
								Gavin was surprised to see that the other wasstill alive—a fact that would no doubt
								change shortly.
							</p>

							<p>
								Four hundred years ago, when it had been founded, the Blackguard hadbeen an Ilytian
								company, chosen as much for their proud relation toLucidonius as for their martial
								skill. But when Ilyta lost influence in theSpectrum, the Blackguard had been forced to
								abandon choosing on thebasis of province and instead had justified their elite position
								on function:when a drafter drafted, his skin filled with the color he was about to
								use.That meant in a fight, a paler-skinned Atashian or Blood Forester drafterwas easier
								to predict. That justification had satisfied the Parians who werealso darker-skinned,
								just fine. Since then, Blackguards had been mostlyParians or Ilytians, with Parians
								gradually becoming the majority as theirpolitical power waxed.
							</p>

							<p>
								But having based their protected status on their fighting prowess, the
							</p>

							<p>
								Blackguard had been forced to accept more than a dozen elite warrior-drafters from
								countries other than Paria and Ilyta over the last two centuries.
							</p>

							<p>
								Karris had joined them because it was impossible to deny her. She’dsparred with every
								member of the Blackguard and defeated all but four ofthem. She was simply the fastest
								drafter Gavin had ever seen, and after herBlackguard training, one of the most
								dangerous. And it meant nothing toher. At the rate she pushed herself, Gavin thought
								she’d be lucky if shelasted another ten years. Probably closer to five. It was like she
								was racinghim to Death’s gates. But she wouldn’t die today.
							</p>

							<p>
								The other horseman charged her, his sword drawn. Karris stood herground, only moving at
								the last second so that she was directly in thehorse’s path. The horseman, expecting her
								to move the other way, was toosurprised to change his course. Karris dropped to the
								ground just as thehorse was about to trample her. With flexible fingers of green and red
								luxinextending from her own hands and crossed, she grabbed the cinch strap asthe horse
								passed over her.
							</p>

							<p>
								The horse thundered past and for a moment Gavin thought she’d beentrampled. Then he saw
								her flipped into the air. The luxin uncrossed andwhipped her back toward the
								still-galloping horse. She crashed into theback of the horseman and almost spilled out
								of the saddle, but shescrambled and managed to maintain her seat behind him.
							</p>

							<p>
								The horseman flailed, having no idea what had just happened or whathad hit him from
								behind. Karris drew her knife as she reached around hishead with her other hand. She
								tore open his visor and buried the knife deepin his face. The man spasmed hard and both
								of them fell.
							</p>

							<p>
								Karris tried to push the horseman down so she’d land on him, but hisfoot never cleared
								the stirrup. Instead of a cushioned landing, she was spunhard backward by his body being
								yanked from under her, and then hit theground and abruptly rolled forward. She had the
								good fortune to land ongrass, though.
							</p>

							<p>
								Gavin looked at the boy they’d just killed thirty of Satrap Garadul’s elitebodyguards to
								save. He was maybe fifteen, chubby, awkward, with eyesround at what he’d just seen. The
								child turned and ran toward the river. Atfirst Gavin thought he was fleeing in fear, but
								then he realized the boy wasgoing to check on his friend, the one Gavin and Karris had
								come too late tosave.“What is the meaning of this?” a man shouted.Gavin turned—and
								cursed himself. He’d been so concerned about theboy and Karris and what was happening
								down toward the river, he hadn’tbeen paying attention to what was happening up the road.
								The roar of therapids and the waterfall had muffled the sound of hooves, but there was
								stillno excuse. The man who’d shouted had the same weak chin that seemed tobeg someone
								to stick a fist in it that he’d had sixteen years ago, the last timeGavin had seen him.
								His whole body was quivering with outrage as he tookin the carnage that was all that
								remained of thirty of his supposedlyinvincible Mirrormen.
							</p>

							<p>
								But Satrap Garadul’s face changed the moment he saw Gavin. He drewrein even as half a
								dozen of his drafters and a score of his Mirrormensurrounded him. “Gavin Guile?”
							</p>

							<p>
								Chapter 17
							</p>

							<p>
								The White was going to kill him.
							</p>

							<p>
								Gavin deserved killing. The presence of Satrap Garadul himself changedeverything. If
								these had merely been Satrap Garadul’s soldiers, as Gavinand Karris expected, Gavin
								could have killed the men and left. SatrapGaradul would be furious and would hunt the
								drafters who had done it, buthe would have had no idea who he was after. It might have
								simply been thatthere was a powerful drafter living in—what was this worthless little
								towncalled? Rekton, that was it. Oh, the irony.
							</p>

							<p>
								It was too late to grab the spectacles Gavin kept in a pocket against sucheventualities.
								With spectacles, with what he’d done, he was a mysteriouspolychrome. Without them, he
								could only be the Prism.
							</p>

							<p>
								So now the Prism himself had moved against Satrap Garadul, and therewas no denying it.
								Rask Garadul knew him.“Gavin?” Satrap Rask Garadul said again. There was something odd
								inhis tone of voice, an intensity, maybe a trap. He was dressed in mail withsegments of
								plate worked in. Smaller segments, not requiring articulatedjoints. His was a poor
								country.
							</p>

							<p>
								He’d changed his seal. It used to be his family’s moon and two stars on afield sable,
								his personalized with a snarling fox. Now both fox and field hadbeen done away with. The
								king’s new seal was a white chain, broken, on ablack field. Gavin knew instantly that
								the symbol was important. Raskwasn’t merely repudiating his name and his father, whom
								he’d alwaysdespised as weak. This was new. Had he fallen under the sway of the heresyof
								the old gods that Gavin had heard rumors about? What was he doing?
							</p>

							<p>
								Why was he asking Gavin’s name when he already knew it was him? Washe giving Gavin an
								opportunity to lie, to say that he wasn’t the Prism?
							</p>

							<p>
								If Gavin did so, what would Rask Garadul do? Kill him and explain laterto the Chromeria
								that it had been a mistake; through no fault of his own,he’d killed an attacker who’d
								disavowed being Gavin Guile. If Raskthought he was going to kill Gavin with a handful of
								drafters and a score ofMirrormen, he was wrong, but what else could it be? Maybe Satrap
								Garadulwas simply as surprised to see Gavin as Gavin was to see him, and he didn’tknow
								how to play this.
							</p>

							<p>
								If Gavin lied and Rask attacked, Gavin would have no choice but to killhim. If he killed
								Rask, he’d have to kill all of Rask’s men. And what wouldthe satrapies make of that?
								More men were coming down the path behindthe satrap even now. Gavin couldn’t kill them
								all. No matter how strong hewas, if a hundred men fled in a hundred directions, some of
								them would getaway. Word would get out that the Prism himself had come to Tyrea
								andassassinated the satrap without provocation.

							<p>
								It didn’t matter that Satrap Garadul was massacring everyone in thistown. It was his
								town; he could do with it as he saw fit. At one time, aPrism could have destroyed or
								killed one of his satraps at will, but that timewas long past. Perhaps back when the
								Seven Satrapies had really beensatrapies. No longer. His power was ceremonial, religious
								only. The Prismwasn’t supposed to interfere in the internal affairs of a nation—and
								Gavinhad already more than just interfered. If he killed everyone here, andskimmed back
								to the Chromeria so he got home within a few days ofhaving left, the Chromeria could
								plausibly deny that he was responsible. Itwas too far away for him to have come and
								gone.
							</p>

							<p>
								He would kill a man he’d never liked; he would stay out of trouble, andthe only people
								to pay for it would be a bunch of soldiers in the mostbackward of the Seven Satrapies.
								Well, the boy might have to die too.Otherwise he could blackmail Gavin. And what would
								Karris think? Well,what did it matter what she thought? She was an impossibility for
								himalready. He’d known he was going to lose what little he had with her todayregardless.
							</p>

							<p>
								The man he’d once been wouldn’t have hesitated.What would you do, brother?It had been so
								long, Gavin wasn’t even sure anymore.“I am the High Lord Prism Gavin Guile,” Gavin said,
								bowing slightly,putting one hand behind his back and trying to wave off Karris.“So, Lord
								Prism,” Satrap Garadul said loudly, “is this how the
							</p>

							<p>
								Chromeria declares war?”“Strange that your thoughts should so quickly go to war,
								Satrap.”“Strange? No, it’s strange you should call me a satrap. You expelled therightful
								satrap, my father, from Garriston, stole that city, our capital andonly port, and have
								denied Tyrea’s people access to the Chromeria. Tyrea isa satrapy no more, and hasn’t
								been since your war, Prism. I am King RaskGaradul of Tyrea. You have murdered my
								personal guards. And you call itstrange that war should occur to us?” Rask’s voice rose.
								“Perhaps you thinkTyreans are bred to be slaughtered by the Chromeria’s lackeys?”
							</p>

							<p>
								There was a rumble among the Mirrormen that told Gavin this kind oftalk was nothing
								new.“But surely the Chromeria wouldn’t send the Prism himself just to kill afew of my
								men.” Rask pretended to be thinking, but didn’t wait longenough for Gavin to get a word
								in. “No. The Prism would only come ifthere was something much more important to
								accomplish. Something thatwould ensure the Chromeria’s stranglehold on the Seven
								Satrapiescontinued. Tell me, Lord Prism, have you come to assassinate me?”
							</p>

							<p>
								One doesn’t send a lion to kill a rat.So help him, Gavin almost said it out loud.There
								was a rattle of armor and stomping of hooves as the Mirrormenand drafters pressed in
								closer to Rask Garadul. Gavin only heard it; he waslooking down the hill. He’d avoided
								looking until now to avoid drawingattention to Karris. By now, she’d probably decided
								whether she was goingto stay or go.
							</p>

							<p>
								She was almost gone, already starting down the swift-flowing river on alittle punt. If
								Gavin knew Karris, though, she would stop and try to see whathappened to him. After all,
								she was a Blackguard, and though their firstresponsibility was always to the White, his
								protection came in a closesecond. He wondered if she’d left because she trusted him,
								because shethought he could fend for himself, or because she had her own mission
								toaccomplish and nothing could be allowed to interfere with that.
							</p>

							<p>
								The stout boy, on the other hand, was now almost directly behind Gavin.
							</p>

							<p>
								After Gavin had saved him once from Mirrormen, apparently he thoughtGavin was his best
								hope to survive.“You misunderstand me, King Garadul,” Gavin said, turning once
								more,committed, letting the title stand. “I saw these men slaughtering theinnocent
								citizens of your satrapy. I intervened to save your people. Ibelieved I was doing you a
								favor.”“Doing me a favor by murdering soldiers in my uniform?”“Renegades, surely.
								Bandits. What sort of madman would burn his owntown to the ground?”
							</p>

							<p>
								Many of the Mirrormen looked away or down and threw furtive glancesat King Garadul.
								Clearly, not all of them had been happy to murder theircountrymen. The king flushed. “I
								am king,” he declared. “I will not havemy choices questioned. Especially not by the
								Chromeria. Tyrea is asovereign nation. Our internal conflicts are no business of yours.”
								Thesoldiers went back to being stony-faced.“Of course not. It’s simply… novel to find a
								king burning his own townand people. Murdering children. You can understand my
								confusion, I’msure. My apologies for this misunderstanding. The Chromeria serves
								theSeven Satrapies. Tyrea included.”
							</p>

							<p>
								It was, perhaps, as well played as Gavin could manage. If they’d beenstanding before
								fifty nobles versed in the interplay of nations and respectfulof diplomacy, it might
								have been enough. Rask Garadul would demandsome monetary consideration, allowing it had
								been an honest andunderstandable error and preserving his own right to have been
								outraged,and Gavin would be understood to have won. Elegant and clean.
							</p>

							<p>
								But Rask Garadul was a young man and a new king. He was notstanding in front of nobles,
								but in front of his men. He saw that he waslosing, but with the bloody corpses piled on
								every side and his men lookingaskance at him, he didn’t think he could afford to lose.
								“Surely you haven’tcome hundreds of leagues simply to patrol our kingdom for bandits?
								Andunannounced, no less. One would think you’d snuck into our kingdomunder cover of
								darkness, like some sort of spy.”
							</p>

							<p>
								Ah, not stupid either. When on a losing path, take a new one, quick.
							</p>

							<p>
								Gavin glanced once more at the boy, to see how he was holding up. Notwell. He was
								practically quivering with terror. He had eyes only for RaskGaradul. Or was that rage?“A
								spy?” Gavin said lightly. “How droll. No no no. One has people todo that sort of thing.
								One doesn’t do it oneself. Surely you’ve been kinglong enough to know this?”“What are
								you doing here?” King Garadul demanded. Again, shockinglyrude if they’d been in a court
								in any capital in the Seven Satrapies. Heglanced at the boy, and Gavin knew he was lost.
								He could leave—he wasthe Prism, after all, and even killing thirty of Garadul’s
								Mirrormen wasn’tenough to justify his seizure or murder. Especially not under
								questionablecircumstances. Rask would risk uniting the satrapies against Tyrea. Killinga
								satrap would be an outrageous breach; killing the Prism would be anunconscionable one.
								But Rask felt he was losing, and he was going to makeGavin pay for that. He was going to
								hurt him as badly as he could.
							</p>

							<p>
								Gavin would be released; the boy would be killed.“I saw smoke,” Gavin said. “One of the
								ways I serve the Seven Satrapiesis by dealing with color wights. I came to help.”“What
								are you doing in our kingdom?”“I wasn’t aware you’d closed your borders. Indeed, I
								wasn’t aware ofthis new ‘kingdom’ at all. This seems needlessly… hostile. Especially
								towish to bar a servant of the realms like myself.” The myth of politedialogue between
								disinterested, reasonable neighbors, that myth uponwhich so much of diplomacy rested,
								was clearly dead, so to turn theattention away, Gavin stepped right over its corpse.
								“Are you hidingsomething, King Garadul?”“You’re from Rekton, aren’t you, boy?” King
								Garadul asked. He wasn’tgoing to play Gavin’s game. “What’s your name? Who’s your
								father?”“I’m Kip. I’ve got no father. Most of us don’t. Not since the war.” It senta
								lance through Gavin’s guts. He’d almost let himself forget. The FalsePrism’s War had
								wiped out dozens of these little towns. All the men, fromboys who couldn’t grow a
								mustache to old men who had to use their spearsas canes, had been pressed into service
								by one side or the other. And he andDazen had sent them against some of the most
								talented drafters the worldhad known. Like lumber to a mill.“What about your mother,
								then?” King Garadul asked, irritated.“Her name was Lina. She helped at a couple of the
								inns.”Gavin’s heart stopped. Lina, the crazy woman who’d sent him the note,was dead.
								This boy, this fearful boy, was supposed to be his son? The onlysurvivor from a town
								burnt to the ground stood here, and he was the onlyone who could cause Gavin grief. If
								Gavin had believed in Orholam, he’dhave thought it a cruel prank.“Lina, yes, I think
								that was the name of the whore,” King Garadul said.“Where is she?”“My mother was no
								whore! And you killed her! You murderer!” Theboy looked near tears, though of rage or
								grief Gavin couldn’t tell.“Dead? She stole something from me. You’ll take us to your
								house, andif we can’t find it, you’ll work for me until you pay it off.”
							</p>

							<p>
								Rask Garadul wasn’t going to have the boy work off his mother’s debt.
							</p>

							<p>
								Gavin had no doubt Rask was lying about the whole thing. It was merely anexcuse to take
								the boy—who, if Rask was a king, was one of the king’ssubjects. Most likely, Rask would
								kill him right in front of Gavin, just tosalve his own pride. The boy meant nothing. He
								could have been a dog or anice blanket for all Rask cared. He’d become a chit. Part of
								Gavin wassickened, and part of him reveled in it.
							</p>

							<p>
								Put me in a situation where I can’t win? Really? You think this isimpossible for me?
								Let’s play.“The boy goes with me,” Gavin said.Rask Garadul smiled unpleasantly. He had a
								gap between his front teeth.
							</p>

							<p>
								He looked more like a bulldog baring its teeth than a man smiling. “You’regoing to risk
								your life for this thief? Hand him over, Prism.”“Or what?” Gavin asked, deliberately
								polite, curious, as if he reallywondered. Threats so often withered when you pulled them
								out into thelight, naked.“Or my men will say how there was a big misunderstanding. We
								had noidea the Prism was here. If only he’d announced his coming. If only hehadn’t been
								confused and attacked my soldiers. We simply defendedourselves. It was only after his
								unfortunate death that we discovered ourerror.”
							</p>

							<p>
								Gavin smirked. He put a fist to his mouth to cover his chuckle. “No,
							</p>

							<p>
								Rask. There’s a reason I don’t travel with Blackguards: I don’t need them.You were just
								a snot-nosed boy during the False Prism’s War, so maybe youdon’t remember what I can do,
								but I can tell that some of your men do.They’re the ones who look nervous. If your men
								attack, I will kill you. TheWhite will be furious with me for a month or two. It will be
								a diplomaticproblem, to be certain, but do you really think anyone cares what happensto
								the king of Tyrea? ‘King,’ not satrap, and thus a rebel. They’ll only wantassurances
								that it won’t happen to them. We’ll make promises andapologies and pay the tuitions of
								all Tyrean students for a few years, andthat will be the end of it. Your successor will
								doubtless be less belligerent.”
							</p>

							<p>
								Rask moved to speak, but Gavin wasn’t about to let him.“But let’s pretend for a moment
								that by some chance you actually killedme without being killed in turn. I see what
								you’re doing here: razing a townso you can raise an army. Founding your own Chromeria.
								The question is,do you think you’re ready, right now, for war? Because if I go back
								now,armed only with words, the Spectrum might not believe me. But if you killme, that
								will be a more elegant testimony than any I could muster. And doyou really think your
								version of what happened is the only version that’sgoing to get out? You are a young
								king, aren’t you? And here you weretalking about spies just moments ago.”
							</p>

							<p>
								Silence stretched cool hands between them. Gavin had won ascompletely as he’d probably
								ever won a pure argument.“The boy is my subject and a thief. He stays.” Garadul’s whole
								bodywas quivering with fury. He wasn’t calling Gavin’s bluff. He was simplyrefusing to
								lose.
							</p>

							<p>
								Gavin hadn’t been bluffing. Nine times out of ten, he could probably killevery one of
								these soldiers and drafters—depending on how good thedrafters were. And he’d probably
								emerge with nothing more than a singedeyebrow. Protecting the child during such a fight
								was another matter. Is itbetter that the guilty should perish, or that the innocent
								should live?
							</p>

							<p>
								And not all of the Seven Satrapies would be quite as quick to forgive ashe’d
								pretended.“He’s no thief,” he said, looking to redirect the conversation from a pure
							</p>

							<p>
								I-win/you-lose bifurcation. “He’s got nothing but the clothes on his back.Whatever his
								mother may or may not have done, it’s nothing to do withhim.”“Easy enough to test, isn’t
								it?” Rask asked. “Search him.”From the look on his face, apparently Kip was a thief.
								Unbelievable.
							</p>

							<p>
								Where was hiding whatever he’d stolen? Between rolls of fat?“No! It’s the last thing she
								gave to me! You took everything else. Youcan’t have it! I’ll kill you first!” There was
								a wildness in the boy’s voicethat Gavin recognized immediately, even before Kip’s irises
								were floodedwith jade green. The boy was going to attack King Garadul, his Mirrormen,and
								his drafters. Very brave, but more stupid.
							</p>

							<p>
								King Garadul’s drafters would see it too.
							</p>

							<p>
								Gavin threw his left hand up in a quick arc, forming a wall of red, green,yellow, and
								blue luxin intertwined between Kip and King Garadul’s men.With his right hand, he
								drafted a blue cudgel and clubbed Kip over the backof the head. The boy crumpled. Only
								Karris, Gavin thought, could havedone it faster.
							</p>

							<p>
								A single red luxin fireball thrown by one of Garadul’s drafters hit thewall and sizzled
								as it plunged into Gavin’s shield, instantly extinguished.
							</p>

							<p>
								Everyone else stood stunned. Gavin released the shield. A few of the
							</p>

							<p>
								Mirrormen were looking again at the corpses of their comrades, maybethinking that their
								deaths were no fluke. Rask Garadul alone seemedunfazed. He dismounted, walked over to
								the unconscious boy, and searchedhim roughly.
							</p>

							<p>
								Rask Garadul produced a slender rosewood case that had been tuckedinside the back of
								Kip’s belt. He opened it a crack, shot a satisfied smile atGavin, and tucked it in his
								own belt. He walked back to his horse andmounted.“A thief and an attempted assassin.
								Thank you for your service in foilingthe attack, Lord Prism.” King Garadul motioned one
								of his men toward Kip.“I think that tree should support a noose. Will you be staying for
								theexecution, Gavin?”
							</p>

							<p>
								So this is where it ends. This is the cost of my sins.“There was no attempt on your
								life, King Garadul. We both know that.
							</p>

							<p>
								The boy didn’t even draft. I was merely disciplining him as a Chromeriastudent for
								considering drafting without permission. You have the box, andyou’ve already murdered
								the supposed thief, his mother. A harshpunishment to be sure, but this is your
								satrapy—er, ‘kingdom.’ It’s obvioushe knew nothing of it except that his mother gave it
								to him. Whatever claimyou have to him pales in comparison to mine.”“He’s my subject, and
								therefore mine to do with as I will.”Only one card left. Gavin said, “You asked earlier
								why I came to thisboiling latrine you call a country. Kip is the reason. My claim to him
								isgreater than yours. He’s my bastard.”
							</p>

							<p>
								Rask Garadul’s eyes went stony, and Gavin knew he had won. No manwould publicly claim a
								dishonor if it weren’t true. He also knew from thatlook, before the man even spoke, that
								he was going to have to kill RaskGaradul. But not today.“Your time is finished,” Rask
								Garadul said. “Yours and the Chromeria’s.
							</p>

							<p>
								You’re done. Light cannot be chained. Know this, Prism: We will take backwhat you’ve
								stolen. The horrors of your reign are almost at an end. Andwhen it ends, I will be
								there. This I swear.”
							</p>

							<p>
								Chapter 18
							</p>

							<p>
								Karris floated the punt downstream until she rounded a corner anddisappeared from sight.
								She didn’t think the soldiers had seen her leave, soshe beached the punt on the opposite
								side of the river and found a hill fromwhich she could see Gavin. She climbed the hill
								on her hands and knees.There were several trees and bushes and long grasses between
								them. Ideal.What wasn’t ideal was the distance. One hundred and twenty paces. Shewas a
								great shot, but the bow she’d brought was a simple recurve, not alongbow. Good and
								portable, very accurate to seventy paces. One twentywas a different question. She
								shuttled the mental abacus. She should beaccurate within four feet, and she could shoot
								rapidly. If Satrap Garadulstood still, she could shoot four arrows within a few seconds,
								correcting forher mistakes. Good enough. At least, better than any of her other
								options.She scooted back from the top of the hill and strung her bow, checked
								thefletching and trueness of her arrows, and crawled back into position, hiddenand
								deadly.
							</p>

							<p>
								When Gavin and the satrap talked for a few minutes, Karris relaxed. Inconversation,
								Gavin could tie anyone in knots except maybe the White.Though Gavin was standing amid
								piles of Rask Garadul’s dead, now it wasprobably just a matter of how much the satrap
								would pay Gavin fortroubling him.
							</p>

							<p>
								Making sure she could still see Gavin and that her weapons were close,
							</p>

							<p>
								Karris opened her pack. The White had told her not to read her orders untilshe’d left
								for Tyrea, so Karris had put the orders in the bottom of her pack,beneath a change of
								clothes, spare spectacles, cooking implements, a fewflares and grenadoes—thank Orholam
								those hadn’t ignited when she fellduring the fight, but they were worth the risk. She
								pulled out the foldednote. As sensitive orders always were, it was made of the thinnest
								paperpossible, the outer folds covered with scribbles so the translucent papercouldn’t
								simply be held up to the light to read what was within. The sealhad a simple spell
								trigger: anyone who simply broke the seal would bringtwo luxin contact points together,
								and there would be a small but instantfire. It wasn’t foolproof, of course: any careful
								drafter could disarm it, orany non-drafter could simply cut around the seal, but
								sometimes simpleprecautions worked where more elaborate schemes did not.
							</p>

							<p>
								Karris checked on Gavin. Still talking. Good.Drafting a bit of green from the grass she
								was sitting on, she unhookedthe trap on the seal. Gavin had told her not to believe what
								was on this note,which had been written by the White herself. So who was more likely to
								lieto her? Gavin, ten times out of ten. The thought made her sick to herstomach. No, she
								was getting ahead of herself. She almost put the noteaway—she could deal with this
								later.
							</p>

							<p>
								But her orders had to do with Tyrea, maybe even with Satrap Garadul,and the satrap was
								standing in her sight. The orders could be to kill him—orto make sure no one else did.
								She had to know right now.
							</p>

							<p>
								She opened the note. The White’s script was a little shaky, but stillexpressive and
								elegant. Karris translated the thin code automatically.“Inasmuch as purple may be the
								new color, we’d all be gratified to knowthe new fashions.” Infiltrate and ascertain the
								satrap’s intentions. The SevenSatrapies and the Chromeria are nervous about the new
								satrap and what hewants.
							</p>

							<p>
								There was a curlicue on the last “s” to let her know the formal code wasended, but the
								note continued. “I also have news of a fifteen-year-old boy ina town called Rekton. His
								mother claims he is G’s. If you have the chance,find out. I’d love to meet them.” Gavin
								had a bastard in Rekton. Bringmother and son to the Chromeria.
							</p>

							<p>
								Karris looked toward Gavin in time to see him draft a cudgel and crackit over the back
								of the boy’s head. It would have been either funny oralarming, except that she felt like
								she’d been hit the same way. Shewatched, dumbfounded, as Gavin threw up a luxin wall,
								quenched anattack, and kept talking—cool to the end.
							</p>

							<p>
								She was so stunned, she didn’t pick up the bow, didn’t draw. This was
							</p>

							<p>
								Rekton. That boy could draft. It was too much of a coincidence. She hadbeen the one who
								insisted Gavin turn the flying contraption here. She felt achill. For them to be here
								now was nothing less than Orholam’s handmoving. Karris knew Orholam didn’t care about
								her. She wasn’t importantenough. So what was this? A test for Gavin?
							</p>

							<p>
								Fifteen years old. Son of a bitch. That child had been conceived whileshe and Gavin were
								betrothed.
							</p>

							<p>
								Gavin picked up the boy, straining—the boy was both tall and chubby—and threw him over a
								shoulder. Then he walked toward the river, as if hedidn’t have a care in the world. The
								man really was walking away from asatrap, leaving thirty of the satrap’s bodyguards
								dead. As always, Gavinwas audacious, unstoppable, unflappable. The ordinary rules just
								didn’tapply to him.
							</p>

							<p>
								Never had.For a single, perilous moment, Karris was sixteen again, with everythingshe
								had known, everyone she had loved torn away. She’d wept that day,wept until she realized
								no one was going to comfort her. She’d drafted redto take comfort from its heat and
								fury. She’d drafted so much red it hadalmost killed her. Today, she didn’t even need to
								draft. The fury was there ina heartbeat. “Don’t believe what’s in your orders,” Gavin
								had said. Ofcourse he had. The liar. The son of a bitch.
							</p>

							<p>
								That was why the White had told her not to open her ordersimmediately. She’d wanted
								Karris to cool off before she had to face Gavin.To not cause problems.
							</p>

							<p>
								Nice to see that the two most important people in her life were bothmanipulating her.
							</p>

							<p>
								Gavin drafted a scull onto the river and set the boy down. He didn’thurry, merely let
								the current take him, not so much as turning. It must havebeen a near thing, then. He
								was treating Satrap Garadul like he was a dogand eye contact might provoke him. Being
								treated like a dog, well, Karrisknew all about that, didn’t she?
							</p>

							<p>
								She found herself on her feet, striding back toward the river. Herspectacles had
								mysteriously found their perch on her nose. If SatrapGaradul weren’t just two hundred
								paces away, Karris thought she’d havehurled a fireball at Gavin’s head. He rounded the
								corner on the punt andsaw the look on her face.
							</p>

							<p>
								He blanched. And, for once, said nothing.
							</p>

							<p>
								Karris stood on the bank of the river, trembling as he floated nearer andnearer.
							</p>

							<p>
								Gavin didn’t ask if she’d read her orders, he could tell. “Get in,” he said.“If you have
								that black cloak, cover yourself. Better that they don’t get agood look at you.”“Go to
								hell. I’ll make my own way,” Karris said.He extended a hand and blasted a fist-size hole
								in her punt with a bulletof green luxin. “Get in!” he commanded. “King Garadul’s coming
								anyminute.”“King?” She drafted green luxin to cover the hole. It was petty anddumb, and
								curse Gavin for making her seem unreasonable. She hated him.She hated him with a passion
								that made all the world fade. Just let thehorsemen come on her now.“He’s rejected the
								Chromeria, the Prism, the Seven Satrapies, Orholamhimself. He’s set himself up as a
								king.” Gavin swept a hand toward herpunt. Hundreds of tiny fingerling missiles flew from
								his hand and stuckquivering in the wood along the entire length and breadth of the punt,
								andthen they burst all at once. Woodchip shrapnel and sawdust sprayed overboth of them.
								Gavin said, “Slap me and be done with it, but get your ass inthe boat.”
							</p>

							<p>
								He was right. Karris got in. This was not the time. She rummagedthrough her pack for the
								cloak and threw it on, pulling up the hood despitethe heat. The boy was still
								unconscious. Gavin didn’t wait, as soon as shewas in, he drafted the oars and straps.
								They hit the water, and the scull spedforward almost immediately. Karris looked back and
								wasn’t much surprisedto see a dozen horsemen crest a hill, coming after them.
							</p>

							<p>
								But it was a hopeless pursuit. The land along the river wasn’t smooth,and Gavin’s scull
								was fast. Gavin and Karris said nothing, not even whenthe scull entered a long section
								of rapids. Karris helped widen the platformwith flexible red luxin and stiffer green,
								giving it a wide and high lip. Gavindrafted slick orange onto the bottom of it so when
								they did hit rocks, theyslid right over them.
							</p>

							<p>
								Within half an hour, they were certainly safe. Still Karris said nothing.
							</p>

							<p>
								How many times could one man hurt you this badly? She couldn’t evenlook at him. She was
								furious with herself. He’d seemed so different afterthe war. His breaking their
								betrothal had left her with nothing. She’d left fora year, and he’d seemed overjoyed
								when she came back. He’d respected herdistance, never said anything when she had a few
								affairs to try to purge himfrom her mind. That had somehow made her more furious. But
								eventually,she’d been drawn back to the mystery of him, and slowly won over by thisman
								who seemed so completely changed by the war.
							</p>

							<p>
								How many men come back from war better?None, apparently.And how many women come back
								smarter?Not this one.The river was joined by another tributary and widened considerably
								and
							</p>

							<p>
								Karris’s place at the prow, looking out for rocks, became unnecessary. Itwas a beautiful
								day. She took off the cloak and felt the sun’s rays—Orholam’s caress, her mother had
								told her when she was a little girl. Right.“They say there are bandits on this river who
								rob anyone who comesthrough,” Gavin said lightly. “So maybe we’ll find someone for you
								to kill.”“I don’t want to kill someone,” Karris said quietly, not meeting his gaze.“Oh,
								you had that look in your eye—”She looked up and smiled sweetly. “Not someone. I want to
								kill you.”
							</p>

							<p>
								Chapter 19“Ah.” Gavin cleared his throat.
							</p>

							<p>
								The boy twitched, and then sat bolt upright. Maybe hearing “I want tokill you” wasn’t
								the best way to be awakened after your village had beenmassacred. Gavin raised an
								eyebrow at Karris. You really need to do thisnow?
							</p>

							<p>
								She huffed out a breath and turned away while the boy rubbed his headand moaned. The boy
								squinted at her, but she kept her back to him. Shebusied herself unstringing her bow and
								stowing it. The boy turned his royalblue eyes to Gavin. Interesting, with his light
								brown skin and kinky hair.Blue eyes were blue because they were the deepest, and thus
								the most light-sensitive and best light-collecting. It was far from the only criterion,
								butpeople with blue eyes were disproportionately represented among the mostpowerful
								drafters. More light to use, more power to burn.
							</p>

							<p>
								Right now, those deep eyes were narrowed in pain. Apparently Gavin’sswat had left the
								boy with a nice headache.“You saved me,” Kip said.Gavin nodded.“Who are you?” the boy
								asked.Straight to the gut, huh? Karris turned to see what Gavin would say. Shefolded her
								arms.
							</p>

							<p>
								Gavin stopped rowing. “This is Lady Karris White Oak, who, despitethe sometimes
								humorously juxtaposed conjunctions of name and skin colorand title, is a member of the
								Blackguard.” Karris’s look of fury didn’t shiftin the slightest. Apparently the old
								jokes still weren’t funny. “And I…”He’d introduced Karris first to give himself a moment
								to think. It hadn’tworked. Five years and five purposes left, Gavin. This might be your
								lastchance.
							</p>

							<p>
								The boy had been unconscious when Gavin had claimed his patrimony.
							</p>

							<p>
								He didn’t know. He didn’t have to know. Better for him not to know, inmany ways. But
								better still for him not to hear it from Karris first, in a burstof rage. This boy was
								not his son, but without Gavin and Dazen’s war—thePrisms’ War or the False Prism’s War,
								depending on which side you’dfought—none of the children of Rekton or a hundred other
								villages wouldbe fatherless now. Gavin fantasized again for a moment about telling
								Karriseverything she didn’t know, and letting the chips fall where they may. ButKarris
								wouldn’t believe a partial truth and couldn’t handle it whole.
							</p>

							<p>
								At least this lie would give an orphan a father. It would give a childwho’d lost
								everything one thing back. Gavin shouldn’t care, but he did.“I’m Prism Gavin Guile. I’m…
								you’re my natural son.”The boy looked at him like he didn’t understand what Gavin had
								said.“Perfect,” Karris said. “Why don’t you just drop everything on him atonce? Why
								don’t you think, Gavin? I swear you’re as impulsive as Dazenever was.”
							</p>

							<p>
								Impulsive? Pot, meet kettle. Gavin ignored Karris, looking only at theboy. He’d just
								admitted to cheating on her years ago, lying to her about itafterward, and then—just an
								hour ago—lying to her again. She was doingcold rage, and it didn’t fit her. Hot rage was
								more her style.
							</p>

							<p>
								The boy glanced at her, confused by her anger, then glanced back. Hewas still squinting,
								though Gavin couldn’t tell how much of that was fromhis headache from being cracked
								across the back of the head, how muchmight be lightsickness from drafting, and how much
								was confusion fromhis rapidly changing situation.“You’re what?” Kip asked.“You’re my
								natural son.” It was too hard, for some reason, to say, “I’myour father.”“And you come
								now?” Kip asked, sick despair painting his face. “Whydidn’t you come yesterday? You
								could have saved everyone!”“I didn’t know you existed until this morning. And we came as
								fast ashumanly possible.” Faster, really. “If your town hadn’t been on fire, wewouldn’t
								have known to come.”“You didn’t know about me? How could you not know?” Kip
								askedplaintively.“Enough!” Gavin roared. “I’m here now! I saved your life, probably
								atthe cost of a war that will make ten thousand more orphans. What more doyou want?”
							</p>

							<p>
								Kip withered, shrank in on himself.“Unbelievable. You bully,” Karris said. “You’re given
								a son, and thefirst thing you do is scream at him. You’re a brave man, Gavin Guile.”
							</p>

							<p>
								The unfairness of it all made Gavin’s fists curl. Justice and injustice andthe insanity
								of this life he’d chosen boiled over. “You want to lecture meabout bravery? Is this the
								woman who ran away from a noble house tobecome a guard? Trying to get yourself killed
								through work or using toomuch magic isn’t bravery, Karris; it’s cowardice. What do you
								want fromme? You want me to bring back your dead brothers?”
							</p>

							<p>
								Karris slapped him. “Don’t,” she said. “Don’t you ever—”“Talk about your brothers? Your
								brothers were vipers. Everyonebreathed a sigh of relief when Dazen killed them. The best
								thing he ever didwas kill them, and the best thing they ever did was die.”
							</p>

							<p>
								Karris’s eyes went red, and luxin curled through her skin in an instant.
							</p>

							<p>
								Gavin felt a stab of fear—not for himself. He could stop whatever she threwhis way. But
								every time a person drafted huge quantities, they hastenedtheir own death. And they
								granted their color more sway over them. Whenhe’d first met Karris, her jade green eyes
								had only the smallest ruby stars inthem. Now, even at rest, when she wasn’t drafting,
								those ruby starsdominated the green.
							</p>

							<p>
								But Karris didn’t attack. She said, “I’m a slow learner, but I finally gotit. You’ve
								betrayed me for the last time, Gavin.” She nearly spat his name.“I—”“You damn stubborn
								woman! I love you, Karris. I’ve always loved you.”It was like the wind went out of her
								sails for a few heartbeats. Red luxindrained from her fingertips. Then, when Gavin was
								just starting to hope, shesaid, “You dare? You unbelievable—you—you—Gavin Guile,
								you’vebrought me nothing but misery and death. We’re finished!” She grabbed herbag and
								jumped off the boat.
							</p>

							<p>
								Gavin was too startled to say anything. He watched as Karris swam toshore and then
								dragged herself and her bag out of the water. She couldtravel to Garriston without him,
								of course, and she’d still arrive earlier thanher contact had expected. There were, of
								course, bandits to worry about,and a woman traveling alone would make a prime target.
							</p>

							<p>
								If the bandits got careless because of that fact, they’d be lucky tosurvive. But
								everyone had to sleep sometime. Karris was being rash, butnothing Gavin could say would
								make any difference. Not for a long while.This was why the White had tried to arrange it
								so he wouldn’t be presentwhen she found out about his bastard. He could go after her,
								but it would beuseless. With her temper, he would only make things worse.
							</p>

							<p>
								Five purposes, and I didn’t even spit out the whole truth.Kip was huddled to one side of
								the boat, trying to be small. He glancedup and met Gavin’s eyes for a moment. “What are
								you staring at?” Gavindemanded.
							</p>

							<p>
								Chapter 20
							</p>

							<p>
								Though she had never drafted a drop of blue, Karris had always had anaffinity for what
								were called the blue virtues. She liked having a plan. Sheliked order, structure,
								hierarchy. Even as a child, she enjoyed learningetiquette. Sitting at a Parian formal
								dinner and knowing the exact functionof every tiny spoon and shell cracker, knowing how
								many times to flick theexcess water from your fingers after washing in the water bowl
								between thefirst and second course, and knowing where exactly to set your
								three-tinedurum to let the table slaves know you were finished eating brought
								hersomething akin to peace. Placing your goblet halfway over the lateraldivisor meant
								you wanted exactly half a glass more wine. On the verticalmeant you’d like to switch
								from white to red. Sign and countersign. Theluxiat’s call and the congregation’s
								response. She loved dance and couldperform most of the dances of the Seven Satrapies.
								She loved music andcould play the gemshorn or accompany herself on the psantria while
								shesang. But nothing she’d learned was helping her now. There was nostructure, no
								hierarchy, no order to direct her.
							</p>

							<p>
								She was supposed to still be on a ship. She was supposed to meet with a
							</p>

							<p>
								Chromeria spy before she got this far into Tyrea. He was supposed to guideher up the
								river to King Garadul’s army and give her a cover that would gether into the army
								without getting killed. Instead, she was dripping wet,alone, and less than a full day’s
								walk from that army, with no introduction,no map, no guidelines, no plan. Gavin and his
								bastard had disappeareddown the river not five minutes ago.
							</p>

							<p>
								I’m getting reckless. The red is destroying me.
							</p>

							<p>
								Karris wrung out her heavy black wool cloak and started looking for aplace to make camp.
								On the hillside there were huge numbers of eucalyptustrees filling the air with their
								fragrance, mixing with the taller pines,blocking out the harsh rays of Orholam’s bright
								eye. It took her only a fewminutes to find a decent spot mostly obscured by brush. She
								gathered woodand made a little pyramid. She didn’t bother with kindling: there
								wereadvantages to being a red. But she did look around carefully for severalminutes
								before she drew out her spectacles from their little pocket up onesleeve. She was alone.
								She drafted a thin thread of red luxin into the base ofher pyramid.
							</p>

							<p>
								Even drafting that much red blew on the coals of her fury. She tuckedaway the red and
								green lenses and thought of smashing Gavin’s grinningface. I love you? How dare he?
							</p>

							<p>
								She shook her head and shook her finger out, flinging away deliberatelyoff-center red
								luxin, getting rid of the excess. As with all luxin draftedimperfectly, it decayed
								rapidly, releasing a paired scent: the smell of resinthat all luxin shared and the odd,
								dried-tea-leaves-and-tobacco smell of redin particular.
							</p>

							<p>
								She took out a flint and her knife instead of drafting sub-red directly fora spark. She
								was already cold, so she struck the spark like a mere mortal.
							</p>

							<p>
								I love you. That bastard.While her wet clothes dried, she changed into the spare
								clothing that hadbeen in her waterproof bag. Tyrean fashion had become mercifully
								practicalin the last fifteen years. Though in social or urban settings women worecalf-
								or ankle-length dresses belted and often accompanied with a wrap or afull jacket for the
								evening, on the trail and in the countryside women oftenwore men’s linen trousers,
								albeit with longer shirts than men wore as a nodto modesty, worn untucked but belted,
								like a tunic. The way CommanderIronfist had explained it to her was that after the False
								Prism’s War, therehadn’t been enough men and boys to harvest the oranges or other
								fruits. Theyoung women who’d joined the harvesters had shortened their skirts tomake it
								easier to climb ladders repeatedly. Clearly someone had objected tothat. Probably not
								the young men holding the ladders.
							</p>

							<p>
								Thus the addition of trousers.Karris liked the clothing. She was used to wearing men’s
								clothes fromtraining with the Blackguard, and if this loose linen didn’t move with her
								asnicely or feel as soft as the stretchy, luxin-infused Blackguard garb, it wasstill
								cool. It also did a better job of camouflaging her body than the tightBlackguard garb.
								No man would dare so much as whistle at a womanBlackguard on the Jaspers, even if she
								was flaunting a hard-earned figure alittle. A woman traveling alone in a far country
								shouldn’t tempt fate morethan necessary.
							</p>

							<p>
								As her little fire burned merrily, Karris distracted herself by armingcarefully. Her
								ataghan would sit concealed and fairly accessible within herpack once the black cloak
								was dried and rolled up. A bich’hwa—a scorpion—was strapped to one thigh inside her
								trousers. It was a weapon with ironrings to fit the fingers, four claws for swiping, and
								a dagger—the scorpion’stail—for stabbing. It wasn’t quickly accessible, but she always
								thought itwas good to have more weapons than were visible. Another long knife wastucked
								into her belt. Her bifocal spectacles went into the bag. Their weightsimply made them
								too obvious if she concealed them in these long, flowingsleeves. That left her with her
								eye caps. The caps, with horizontallystreaked lenses of red and green, each fit onto an
								eye socket, as tight andclose to the eye as possible. A thin ridge of sticky red luxin
								made sure thelenses would stay on her face—and, if she weren’t careful, would rip
								offhalf her eyebrow when she removed them. The sticky red luxin wasshielded with a
								little strip of solid yellow luxin that was to be torn offbefore you stuck the caps onto
								your eyes.
							</p>

							<p>
								For all that the eye caps had saved her life a time or three, Karris didn’tlike them.
								Naturally long eyelashes were a nice accessory at the Luxlords’Ball, but not so much
								when you had a lens a finger’s breadth from your eye.
							</p>

							<p>
								Karris hid her caps in plain sight, on a necklace made of chunkymulticolored stones,
								none so clear or interesting as to make the necklaceseem valuable. The caps clicked
								together around one link and blended withall the other stones. Another pair of caps was
								tucked under her belt buckle.
							</p>

							<p>
								I’m stalling, she thought.From where she was now, she had only two choices. She could
								headdown the river and meet up with her contact in Garriston and then comeback up the
								river, or she could try to infiltrate King Garadul’s army on herown. Going down the
								river would waste time, and she’d still be much tooearly. There was also the threat of
								bandits. She assumed her contact wouldhave some good way of circumventing them on the
								way back up, but thatwouldn’t help her as she headed downriver. Going on alone would
								meantrying to join a hostile army without a proper introduction. And now that
							</p>

							<p>
								Gavin had clashed with King Garadul, the king knew that the Chromeriahad already gotten
								one drafter here, so surely he would be doublysuspicious of anyone else showing up.
							</p>

							<p>
								In fact, Gavin’s little stunt in Rekton had probably made her workimpossible. There were
								certainly Tyreans as pale as she was, but her accentwas wrong, and she was a drafter. To
								a suspicious camp, everything abouther would scream spy. The White’s orders had never
								factored in thecircumstances in which she found herself now. It was like sitting at
								whatyou thought was a dignified Parian dinner with its rules, and findingyourself seated
								with raucous Ilytian pirates feeding you blowfish instead.There were rules for that too,
								and if you broke them, you’d consume a nicetender morsel that contained a poison that
								would leave you in agony for tenminutes, at which point it would leave you dead.
							</p>

							<p>
								And Karris didn’t know the rules here.Of course, Gavin would just eat the whole damned
								fish—and somehow,miraculously, it wouldn’t harm him. Everything was effortless for
								Gavin.He’d never had to work hard for anything. Born with a monumental talentto a
								scheming rich father, he simply took what he wanted. Even the rules ofbeing a Prism
								didn’t constrain him—he traveled to and fro about the SevenSatrapies without so much as
								a Blackguard escort when he didn’t want one.And now he could cross the Cerulean Sea in a
								few hours. For Orholam’ssake, now he could fly.
							</p>

							<p>
								Get out of my head, liar. I’m done with you.The lines didn’t fit. The tiny spoons were
								gone, and the urums had athousand tines instead of three. Fine. Karris wasn’t going
								home. She wasn’tgoing to wait for some man to come hold her hand and get her
								intoGaradul’s camp. She wasn’t going to fail. There was more than one way tofind out
								what King Garadul’s plans were.
							</p>

							<p>
								Of course, she didn’t know what those were, but she was going to figureit out. As for
								now, she remembered something her brother Koios used to saybefore he’d been killed in
								the fire: “When you don’t know what to do, dowhat’s right and do what’s in front of you.
								But not necessarily what’s rightin front of you.”
							</p>

							<p>
								The town of Rekton had been burned to the ground. There had been onesurvivor. There
								might be more, and if there were, they would be indesperate need of help and possibly
								protection. Those, Karris could provide.
							</p>

							<p>
								And if it involved lighting some jackass up with a fireball the size of asmall house, so
								much the better.
							</p>

							<p>
								Chapter 21
							</p>

							<p>
								They practically flew down the river. Kip had never traveled so fast in hislife. And the
								Prism didn’t speak a word, sunk into his own dark mood. Formost of the afternoon, Gavin
								Guile worked what the scull had in the placeof oars—for a while, it would be almost like
								a ladder, then it would be likethe bellows of a forge, then it would be oars, then it
								would be a rollingtrack. Gavin worked at one until he was exhausted, muscles
								quivering,sweat matting his thin shirt. Then he would draft a little, the oars
								wouldchange to some new shape that gave his most weary muscles a rest, and hewould keep
								going.
							</p>

							<p>
								When Kip finally found his voice, he said, “Sir, um, he took my case?”
							</p>

							<p>
								He wasn’t going to ask about Karris White Oak or what Gavin had said.Not now. Not ever.
							</p>

							<p>
								Gavin looked at Kip, his mouth tight. Kip regretted speaking at once. “Itwas that or
								your life.”
							</p>

							<p>
								Kip paused, then said, “Thank you, sir. For saving me.” That seemedlike a better choice
								than saying, But that was mine! It was the last thing—the only thing—my mother ever gave
								me!“You’re welcome,” Gavin said. He glanced back up the river, histhoughts obviously
								elsewhere.“That man, he’s responsible for killing my mother, isn’t he?” Kip
								asked.“Yes.”“I thought you were going to kill him right there. But you stopped.”Gavin
								glanced at him, weighing him. His voice was distant. “I wasn’twilling for the innocent
								to die so I could kill the guilty.”“Those men weren’t innocent! They murdered everyone I
								know!” Tearsleaked down Kip’s face. He felt ragged, wrung out, finished.“I was talking
								about you.”It caught Kip short, but his emotions were still a jumble. His presencehad
								kept Gavin from killing King Garadul. He didn’t know words thatcould convey his feelings
								for that. He’d failed his mother again. He’dactually blocked her vengeance by his own
								incompetence.
							</p>

							<p>
								I’ll make good, mother. On my soul. I’ll kill him. I swear it.Half a dozen small
								villages passed, and dozens of boats. Fed bytributaries, the river widened. But Gavin
								stopped only once, to buy aroasted chicken and bread and wine. He threw the food to Kip.
								“Eat.” Thenthey were off again. Gavin didn’t eat. He didn’t speak or even slow whenthey
								passed the fishermen startled by their appearance.
							</p>

							<p>
								It wasn’t until the sun set and Gavin shifted the oars again that Kipventured to speak
								once more. “Can I help… sir?”
							</p>

							<p>
								The Prism gave him an appraising glance, as if he hadn’t even thoughtof having him help.
								But when he spoke, he said, “I’d really appreciate that.Here, stand on this and just
								walk.” He’d been running. “You can use thesehand oars to help if you want. Steer by
								dropping in the hand oar on the sideyou want to turn toward. Port for port, starboard
								for starboard, right?”“Port is left?”“Right.”Kip blinked. Uh…“Port is right?”“Only if
								you’re facing aft.”The panic must have been clear on Kip’s face, because Gavin
								chuckled.“It doesn’t matter. You just go until you’re too tired, or if we hit rapids
								orbandits. I’m going to rest for a bit.” Gavin sat in Kip’s place and tore intothe
								remains of the chicken and bread. He watched as Kip struggled withgetting the scull up
								to a halfway decent pace. Kip turned a time or two—itactually was pretty simple—and
								looked at Gavin to see if he approved, butthe Prism was already asleep.
							</p>

							<p>
								The quarter moon was straight overhead as night fell and Kip beganwalking. Even driven
								only by Kip’s walking, the scull was fast. Gavin hadnarrowed the hull even further when
								Karris had left, so the boat seemedmore to hover over the water than plow through it.
								For the first fewminutes, Kip was gripped with anxiety. Every turn he was sure they
								wouldconfront bandits and the Prism wouldn’t awaken. But soon he fell into therhythms of
								the boat, the waves, and the night.
							</p>

							<p>
								An owl was hooting in the distance, and little bats were swooping anddiving, eating the
								insects that flew high above the water while trout leapt toeat those that flew too low.
								The scull startled a heron, which flew off intothe night on great blue wings.
							</p>

							<p>
								Gradually, the peace of the night seeped into Kip. The surface of theriver became as
								smooth as a mirror, and the stars shone in it. He saw duckshuddled on the shore, their
								heads tucked into their wings. And then helooked once more at the man who was supposedly
								his father.
							</p>

							<p>
								Gavin Guile was a muscular man, broad-shouldered but as slender as
							</p>

							<p>
								Kip was fat. Kip searched for any resemblance at all, some hint that thiscould be true.
								Gavin was lighter-skinned; he looked like a mix between aRuthgari, who had green or
								brown eyes, dark hair, and olive skin, and aBlood Forester, with their cornflower blue
								eyes and flaming red hair anddeathly pale skin. Gavin’s hair was the color of burnished
								copper, and hiseyes, of course, were those of a Prism. When he was drafting they
								lookedwhatever color he was using at the moment, and could change in an instant.When he
								wasn’t drafting, Gavin’s eyes shimmered as if they were prismsthemselves, every little
								twitch sending a cascade of new colors through hisirises. They were the most
								disconcerting eyes Kip had ever seen. They wereeyes to make satraps squirm and queens
								faint. The eyes of Orholam’sChosen.
							</p>

							<p>
								Kip’s eyes were plain blue, which did nothing for him except mark himas a crossbreed.
								Maybe some Blood Forester lineage. Like most peoples,Tyreans had dark eyes. Kip’s hair
								was dark as a Tyrean’s, but tightly curledlike a Parian’s or an Ilytian’s, rather than
								straight or wavy. Enough to markhim a freak, but nowhere near enough to mark him this
								man’s son. Ofcourse, his mother hadn’t had the look of a Tyrean either, which
								justcomplicated things. Darker than either, with kinky hair and hazel eyes. Kiptried to
								imagine what the child of his mother and this man might look like,but he couldn’t do it.
								Blend enough mutts, and who knows what you’ll get?Maybe if he weren’t so fat he might
								see it. Maybe it was simply a crueltrick. A lie.
							</p>

							<p>
								The Prism. The Prism himself? How could such a man be Kip’s father?
							</p>

							<p>
								He’d said he hadn’t known Kip even existed. How could that happen?
							</p>

							<p>
								The answer seemed pretty obvious. It had been during the war. Gavin’sarmy had met
								Dazen’s not far from Rekton. So as they’d come throughtown, Gavin had met Lina. He was
								the Prism, heading to what might be hisdeath. She was a young, pretty girl whose town
								had been destroyed. She’dshared his bed. Then he’d gone on to kill his brother—perhaps
								the very nextday—and in the aftermath of the war and the reconstruction and the work
								ofputting down the rest of the rebellion and rebuilding alliances andadministering the
								peace, he’d probably never thought of her again. Even ifhe had, Tyrea wasn’t exactly the
								friendliest or safest of places for the Prismback then. It had sided with Dazen, the
								evil brother, and been treated cruellyas a result.
							</p>

							<p>
								Or maybe Gavin had raped Lina. But that didn’t make sense. Whywould a rapist claim Kip?
								Especially because it obviously cost Gavin a lotto do so.
							</p>

							<p>
								Kip could imagine his mother, pregnant, unmarried, left in thedevastation that was
								Rekton. Of course she’d want to escape. Kip wouldhave been her one hope. What would she
								have done? Travel, alone, toGarriston, where the victors were administering Tyrea? He
								could imaginethat well enough. His mother, presenting herself to some governor,demanding
								to see Gavin Guile because she bore his bastard. She’d havebeen lucky if she got as far
								as a governor with that tale. So she’d beenturned away, her dreams of anything good or
								easy in her life dashed.
							</p>

							<p>
								Whenever she looked at Kip, she didn’t see her own bad choices, shesaw Gavin’s
								“betrayal” and her disappointment. Kip was a dream dashed.
							</p>

							<p>
								Within half an hour, Kip was tiring. His arms were burning. He thoughtof how Gavin had
								practically sprinted for hours. The thought of waking thePrism so soon shamed him. He’d
								always tired quickly, but if he pushedthrough his initial fatigue he had a lot of
								stamina.
							</p>

							<p>
								He wasn’t going to wake the Prism. Not at all. Let the man rest. He’dearned that much
								from Kip. Kip would keep going until Gavin woke. Evenif it killed him. He swore it.
							</p>

							<p>
								The oath made Kip feel good. He was insignificant. A nothing. But hecould give the Prism
								himself a good night’s sleep. He could do something.He could matter, in a small way, but
								a bigger way than he ever had in hiswhole life.
							</p>

							<p>
								He kept going. The Prism had saved him today. The Prism himself!
							</p>

							<p>
								Gavin had faced down King Garadul. He’d killed a score or more of
							</p>

							<p>
								Garadul’s Mirrormen—and walked away. And Kip had probablyendangered it all by trying to
								attack the king. How stupid could he get?With all the drafters there, Kip had thought he
								could get to the king? Stupid!
							</p>

							<p>
								Despite the coolness of the night, it wasn’t long before Kip was coveredin sweat. His
								fast walk had become a trudge, but that trudge still drove thescull as fast as a horse’s
								canter.
							</p>

							<p>
								Kip was so focused on just keeping going that he was on top of thecamp before he noticed
								it. There were maybe a dozen men carousingaround a fire, drinking and laughing as one
								strummed a badly out-of-tunelute. Kip kept trudging, his brain slow to take in what this
								had to be. Themen were all armed, including one who looked like he was supposed to beon
								watch—that one still held his crossbow cocked and ready against hisshoulder.
							</p>

							<p>
								Kip thought of whispering to wake Gavin, but they were so close thatanything loud enough
								to wake the Prism might be loud enough to carry overthe river to the crossbowman who
								stood just at the edge of the firelight, hisbody turned toward the river but his head
								turned to his comrades.
							</p>

							<p>
								The scull made only a slight hiss as it cut across the water. Surely itwould be
								inaudible beneath the merry crackling of the bandits’ fire. Thebandits had partially
								dammed the river, with rocks pinching in from eitherside. They’d laid wood planks over
								the top to make a walkway with only atiny gap in the middle. Any boat that tried to get
								through would be withinrange of at least their spears.
							</p>

							<p>
								Kip could disengage himself from the oars and touch Gavin—but whatcould Gavin do? It was
								night. There wasn’t much light for a Prism to workwith. Maybe if Kip had woken him
								earlier. Now it was too late. He’dprobably killed them. He’d have to shoot for the gap
								and hope for the best.
							</p>

							<p>
								He aimed the scull at the gap and gasped as at the last second themoonlight cut through
								the water and revealed the bandits’ last trap: a stout,sharpened pole was embedded in
								the riverbed and stuck up to within a fewthumbs of the surface of the water. Anyone who
								tried to shoot the gapwould find themselves hung up, with a gaping hole in their hull.
							</p>

							<p>
								The scull’s luxin hull barely brushed the pole and slid past.Kip shot a glance at the
								crossbowman as the scull slipped through theteeth of the bandits’ trap. The man was only
								a few years older than Kip. Hewas laughing, happy, hand extended to one of the other
								men, asking for askin of wine.
							</p>

							<p>
								Then Kip was through. The crossbowman turned, shaking his head, thenfroze as he saw Kip.
								In the dark, the translucent luxin must have been well-nigh invisible to the sentry’s
								fire-spoiled night vision. He was seeing a fatboy running past him—on the river’s
								surface. Impossible.
							</p>

							<p>
								Kip smiled and waved.The sentry lifted a hand and waved back. Froze. Looked back at
								hiscomrades at the fire. His mouth opened to shout an alarum, but nothingcame out. He
								turned back to the river and looked for Kip.
							</p>

							<p>
								Kip was still within easy crossbow shot. He knew that, but he didn’tspeed up, even
								though—at this moment—he had energy to spare. Anythinghe did might spook the sentry.
							</p>

							<p>
								The sentry stared hard into the darkness at the disappearing ghost—andsaid nothing. He
								rubbed his forehead in consternation, shook his head, andturned back to his friends.
								Then Kip ran, not for long, but after a minute ofrunning the scull was hundreds of paces
								downriver. Kip returned to hiswalk. He smiled. Stupid as it had been, he’d made it
								through without evenwaking the Prism.
							</p>

							<p>
								He didn’t know how long he walked. He tried to keep an eye on theshore, but weariness
								had sunk into his bones. He passed smaller camps—whether of bandits or just innocent
								travelers, he couldn’t tell. But each timehe saw them, he slowed to a crawl until he
								could see that all the men in thecamp were asleep. He even did his trick again of
								unfocusing his eyes, andhe could see the sleeping lumps of several more men than his
								focused eyescould, but never another sentry.
							</p>

							<p>
								The sky didn’t lighten for what seemed a thousand years. Kip’s legswere burning. His
								lungs ached. He could barely feel his arms, but herefused to stop. Even at his bare
								trudge, the scull still moved twice as fast asa punt.
							</p>

							<p>
								Finally, the sun touched the mountains. As always, daylight came longbefore the sun
								could climb the Karsos Mountains’ backs to announcesunrise. And still the Prism didn’t
								wake. Kip wouldn’t stop walking. Notnow. He’d gone all night. Surely the Prism would
								wake any moment andsee what Kip had done. He would be impressed. He would look at Kip
								withnew eyes. Kip would be more than a burden, a shame, a bastard to bequietly admitted
								and then avoided.
							</p>

							<p>
								The Prism stirred, and Kip’s heart leapt. But then the man settled backin, his breathing
								steady once more. Kip despaired. He looked to the risingsun. Was he going to have to
								wait until the light shone directly on thePrism’s face? That would be another hour at
								least. Kip swallowed. Histongue felt thick and dry, raspy as a file. How long had it
								been since he’dhad a drink? A river beneath his feet, and he was parched.
							</p>

							<p>
								He needed a drink. He was past needing a drink. If he didn’t drink, hewas going to pass
								out. The Prism’s wineskin wasn’t even a full pace away.Kip stopped walking. His legs
								quivered. His feet were numb, and now theyhurt as the blood leached back into them. He
								extricated himself from the oarmechanism and stepped over to grab the wineskin.
							</p>

							<p>
								Or tried to. His numb feet got tangled up and he pitched forward, barelyable to twist
								one way so he didn’t crush the Prism. His turned shoulderslammed onto the scull’s
								gunwale, and suddenly everything that had beengood about the scull turned bad. The
								shallow displacement that had allowedthe boat to slip over the bandits’ trap meant no
								stability. The bowl-like flareof the slick hull that had allowed them to slide over
								rocks meant that thesudden shift in weight was cataclysmic.
							</p>

							<p>
								One moment, Kip was staring at the river from thumbs away. The next,the entire scull
								flipped. Kip’s head went in first. And yet despite the waterclosing over his ears and
								the thrashing of his own stupid clumsy limbs andthe crashing of the rest of the scull
								hitting the water, somehow he wascertain he heard a man’s startled yell.
							</p>

							<p>
								The river was warm. Kip was so mortified, he decided to just die and getit over with.
								He’d just dunked the Prism into the river. Orholam!
							</p>

							<p>
								Oh, he’ll be real impressed now, Kip.Then his lungs started burning, and the idea of
								quietly dying to removeone ignominious blot from creation lost all appeal. Kip thrashed,
								weakly.His legs decided now would be a good time to cramp, and both did. Thenhis left
								arm. He flapped in the water like a lame bird, got one gulp of air,and plunged back
								down. Part of him knew he could float. He’d floatedleagues down the river just
								yesterday, but panic had him fully in its grip. Hefloundered, took a breath at the wrong
								time, and sucked in water.
							</p>

							<p>
								His head hurt. Orholam, it was like someone was ripping out all of hishair.
							</p>

							<p>
								He spit and spluttered. He was in air! Sweet, precious air! Someone hadgrabbed him by
								the hair and pulled him out of the water. He coughed twicemore and finally opened his
								eyes.
							</p>

							<p>
								The Prism was winking at him—no, not winking. The Prism wasblinking away the water that
								Kip had just spat up into his face.
							</p>

							<p>
								Let me die now.The man hauled Kip into the scull—now wider, with a keel, and muchmore
								stable than before. Kip hung his head and rubbed his arm and legsuntil they could move
								again. The Prism was standing over him, waiting.Kip swallowed, wincing, and braced
								himself to meet the great man’s fury.He looked up sheepishly.“Love a morning swim,”
								Gavin said. “Quite bracing.” And he winked.
							</p>

							<p>
								Chapter 22
							</p>

							<p>
								Dazen Guile woke slowly, senses bombarded with the stultifying blueblandness of his
								dungeon. Three thunks, three hisses, and his breakfast fellonto the dungeon floor.
								Ignoring the cold in his limbs, ignoring the stiffnessand pain in his body from sleeping
								on blue luxin with only a thin blanket,he sat and folded his arms.
							</p>

							<p>
								The dead man was whistling tunelessly, sitting against the opposite wall,bobbing his
								head to a nonexistent beat.
							</p>

							<p>
								The madness of blue was a madness of order. A giist would understandevery nuance of
								Gavin’s prison. But every time Dazen sank into themadness, he was frightened that he’d
								never come out of it. The last timehe’d tried must have been years ago. He’d drafted a
								lot of blue since then.Choosing a descent into the blue again might well be choosing
								annihilation.“Dazen,” the dead man said. “You are Dazen this morning, aren’t you?”
							</p>

							<p>
								It was a favorite trick of the dead man’s, pretending Dazen was the crazyone. “You
								aren’t thinking of going giist, are you?”
							</p>

							<p>
								He hated his brother for doing this, for forcing this choice. But there wasno passion to
								his hatred. It was a bare fact, as naked as his own limbs,stripped of mystery.
							</p>

							<p>
								Enough. Better oblivion chosen of his own will than torture foreveraccording to his
								brother’s.
							</p>

							<p>
								Dazen drafted blue like he was taking a deep breath. His fingernailsturned that hateful
								blue, his hands, arms. It spread over his chest like an icycancer, and it cooled him.
								His hatred itself became an oddity, a mystery,something so irrational and powerful it
								couldn’t be quantified orunderstood, merely accounted for approximately. The blue
								suffused hisentire body.“Bad idea,” the dead man said. “I don’t think you’ll come out of
								it thistime.” He started juggling little blue luxin globes. He could handle fivenow.
								When Dazen had first met him, the dead man couldn’t even jugglethree.
							</p>

							<p>
								Without passion clouding his study, he could appreciate the cell. Hisbrother was
								brilliant. What had he said after imprisoning him? “I made thisdungeon in a month, you
								will have as long to break out as it takes. Considerit a test.” Every time he had given
								up, he’d returned to that statement. It wasan admission of imperfection. The cell could
								be broken. There was aweakness; he merely had to find it.“The hellstone isn’t the
								weakness,” the dead man said. “Didn’t I tellyou? He respects you too much. It won’t go a
								few thumbs deep, it’ll go twopaces.”
							</p>

							<p>
								He was aware, briefly, of a human emotion barely at the threshold of hisperception.
								Loss—fury at how he’d scrubbed piss and oil for years, years ofdegradation, for nothing.
								His brother had no interest in degrading him. Thatwasn’t his way. All that effort, for
								nothing. He turned those feelings overlike an odd stone in his hands, then tossed them
								aside. They only cloudedhis vision.
							</p>

							<p>
								Something was sitting right in front of his face, and he wasn’t seeing it.
							</p>

							<p>
								It had to be something obvious, something that simply required him to lookat the problem
								from a new angle. His brother had been so good at that kindof thinking.“Maybe the only
								question is, are you going to do this Gavin’s way, or
							</p>

							<p>
								Dazen’s?” the dead man asked. He had that little superior, mocking smile.Dazen wanted to
								smash his face in when he grinned like that.
							</p>

							<p>
								But maybe he was right. That was the trap: trying to do this Gavin’sway. If he did this
								his brother’s way, it would only lead deeper.
							</p>

							<p>
								He put his luxin-filled hands to the ground, feeling the outline of thewhole structure.
								The cell was sealed, of course, hardened and guardedagainst simple magical tampering,
								but as before, it felt different to thesouth. Not that he was sure it was the south
								side, he’d merely decided thatthe one area that felt different would be the south for
								him, his lodestone.That was where his brother stood when he came to see him. It
								hadn’thappened in a long time, but there was a room beyond the blue luxin wallsthere,
								where Gavin could come when he wanted to check on his brother, toassure himself that he
								was still a prisoner, still safely kept from the world,still suffering as much as he
								hoped.
							</p>

							<p>
								That would be the weakness. The luxin there had to be thinner, simpler,so Gavin could
								manipulate it so that he could see through it. It would bewarded, of course, but Gavin
								couldn’t have thought of everything. He’donly had a month.
							</p>

							<p>
								But Dazen’s every attempt with fire had been a failure. Red luxin wasflammable, so he’d
								thought that if he cut himself, he could draft red luxin.He could, a little. But that
								was good for nothing unless he could make itburn. A fire would give him full-spectrum
								light to work with—and hewould be able to get out. But he had nothing to make a spark.
								Trying toleach heat from his own body had nearly worked—or at least he’d thoughthe was
								close, and he’d nearly killed himself the last time by cooling hisbody too much.
							</p>

							<p>
								It just wasn’t possible. He was going to die down here. There wasnothing he could do.
							</p>

							<p>
								He drafted a sledgehammer and, screaming, smashed it against the wall.
							</p>

							<p>
								It shattered, of course. It didn’t leave so much as a scratch.
							</p>

							<p>
								Dazen rubbed his face. No, the enemy was despair. He had to conservehis strength.
								Tomorrow he’d rub the bowl more. Maybe tomorrow would bethe day.
							</p>

							<p>
								He knew it wouldn’t, but he held on to the lie anyway.In the wall, the dead man was
								cackling.
							</p>

							<p>
								Chapter 23“We need to talk about your future,” Gavin said. “You have some choices.”
							</p>

							<p>
								Kip looked at the Prism across their fire. Night was coming on fast intheir little
								island. Kip had slept for hours, apparently, completely missingGarriston and only waking
								as their boat lurched, hitting the sand as nightfell.“How long will I live?” Kip asked.
								He was grumpy, hungry, and juststarting to comprehend some of the implications of what
								had happened inthe last two days.“A question for Orholam himself. I’m just his humble
								Prism,” Gavinsaid, a wry smile twisting his lips. He was looking out into the
								darkness.“You know what I mean.” It came out sharper than Kip meant. Everyonehe knew was
								dead, and he was going to be a green drafter. He’d seen hisfuture in the color wight:
								death or madness and then death.
							</p>

							<p>
								Gavin’s eyes snapped back to Kip. He moved to speak, stopped, thensaid, “When you draft,
								it changes your body, and your body interprets thatchange as damage—it heals what it
								can, but it’s always a losing battle, likeaging. Most male drafters make it to forty.
								Women average fifty.”“Then the Chromeria kills us or we go mad?”Gavin’s face went hard.
								“You’re getting emotional. I don’t think you’reready for this.”“Not ready?” Kip said.
								Gavin was right, Kip knew it. He was on edge.
							</p>

							<p>
								He should just shut up, but he couldn’t help himself. “I wasn’t ready foreveryone I know
								to be murdered. I wasn’t ready to impale some horsemenand jump over a waterfall. Words
								are nothing. What is it? Once we aren’tuseful anymore, we have to kill ourselves?” Why
								was he yelling? Why washe trembling? Orholam, he’d sworn on his soul to kill a king, was
								he madalready?“Something like that.”“That or turn into a color wight?” Kip asked.“That’s
								right.”“Well, I guess we’ve talked about my future,” Kip said bitterly. He knewhe was
								being snotty, but he couldn’t stop himself.“That wasn’t what I meant, and you know it,”
								Gavin said.“How would you know what I know, father?”It was like watching a spring
								release. One second, the Prism was sittingacross the fire from Kip. The next, he stood
								right in front of Kip, his armdrawn back. The next, Kip was hitting the sand, head
								ringing from Gavin’sopenhanded blow, ass scraped from sliding off his log, his wind
								taken bythe fall.“You’ve been through hell, so I’ve given you more slack than I give
								anyman. You wanted to find the line? You’ve found it.”
							</p>

							<p>
								Kip rolled face up as he caught his breath. He had sand sticking to thewetness at the
								corner of his mouth. He rubbed it. Just slobber, not blood.“Orholam’s balls!” he said.
								“Guess what I’ve found? A line! I’m thegreatest discoverer since Ariss the Navigator!”
							</p>

							<p>
								Gavin trembled, his face a mask. He rolled his shoulders, popped hisneck right and left.
								Though his back was to their fire, Kip could see redluxin smoke-swirls curling into his
								eyes.“What are you going to do? Beat me?” Kip demanded. It’s just pain.Sometimes Kip
								hated himself for how he saw weakness. The Prismthreatened him and the first thing Kip
								saw was the threat’s emptiness. Gavincouldn’t beat him precisely because Gavin was a
								good man and Kip wasdefenseless.
							</p>

							<p>
								Gavin’s look darkened to murder for one moment, then cleared to simpleintensity. The
								briefest flicker of amusement. “Take a deep breath,” he saidquietly.“What?”The Prism
								made a little backhanded gesture, as if whisking away a fly. Agob of red luxin flicked
								out of his hand and splattered over Kip’s mouth.Kip took a deep breath through his nose
								before the luxin spread and coveredthat, too. Then it wrapped around the back of his
								head, spread over the topof his head, and solidified. Only Kip’s eyes were uncovered,
								mouth andnose were covered, utterly blocked. He couldn’t breathe.
							</p>

							<p>
								Gavin said, “You remind me of my brother. I could never win againsthim growing up. And
								when I did, he’d give me some patronizing praise thatmade me wonder if he’d let me win.
								You see the cracks in things? Fine. It’sproof enough that you’re a Guile. Our whole
								family has it. Including me.Think about this, Kip: there are a lot of problems that
								would go away forme if I leave that mask on your face until you’re dead. You might want
								tothink twice before you try to use a man’s conscience against him. It mayturn out he
								doesn’t have one.”
							</p>

							<p>
								Kip listened, conserving his strength against his rising panic, certain thatafter Gavin
								was done talking, he would take the luxin off his face. ButGavin stopped talking, and he
								didn’t remove the mask. Kip’s stomachchurned as his diaphragm worked to suck in more
								air, pumped down toexpel the dead air he held in. Nothing.
							</p>

							<p>
								He reached up to his neck, trying to find the seam where luxin abuttedskin. But the line
								was smooth, the luxin sticking close to the skin. Hecouldn’t get his fingernails under
								it. He reached up around his head, hiseyes. If he stabbed his fingernails into the soft
								skin next to his eyes, hecould lift the edge of the mask and get one finger underneath
								it. His visionwas darkening. He looked at Gavin, pleading, sure that the man would
								stepin now.
							</p>

							<p>
								Gavin watched him, pitiless. “If the only thing you’re going to respect isstrength, Kip,
								first, you’re a fool, and second, you’ve come to the rightman.”
							</p>

							<p>
								The panic came. He should have known better. Kip thrashed, tried toscream, reached up to
								that thin ridge of luxin by his eyes—but he barelytouched it before his hands drooped.
								He should have known he couldn’ttrust…
							</p>

							<p>
								Chapter 24
							</p>

							<p>
								After traveling all day and into the night, Karris first became aware ofRekton in the
								distance as a great, unvariegated glow as she stalked throughthe forest. It was long
								after nightfall now, the air cool in the undergrowth.She was enough of a sub-red to use
								dark vision, but it wasn’t perfect, andon a moonlit night like tonight she kept
								switching back and forth fromnormal to dark vision. Light below the visible spectrum was
								rougher; itdidn’t lend itself to fine differentiation of features. Even faces
								simplylooked like warm blobs, brighter here and there, but it was much moredifficult to
								make out expressions or fine movements—or even to identify aface from much of a
								distance.
							</p>

							<p>
								The glow meant Rekton was still burning. Karris circled it slowly,climbing the last
								hill. She stayed off the road, admiring the waterfall justbelow the town in the silver
								moonlight. She hadn’t seen anyone on the roadall day, which she found odd. If no one was
								fleeing downriver from Rekton,it probably meant no one had made it out. But it was also
								strange to followthe river through arable land and not come across any other
								settlements.She’d seen orange orchards that clearly hadn’t been tended since the war,but
								they were still growing fruit. The fruit was sparse and the trees leafyand chaotic and
								growing haphazardly in comparison to the paintings Karrishad seen of orange harvests,
								but they were still here. With the price Tyreanoranges fetched, she found that hard to
								believe. Tyrean oranges weresmaller but sweeter and juicier than Atashian oranges, and
								the Parianoranges didn’t even compare. No one had moved back after the war?
							</p>

							<p>
								Had the Battle of Sundered Rock really killed so many that even now,sixteen years later,
								the land lay fallow, bearing fruit for deer and bearsalone?
							</p>

							<p>
								Karris didn’t see any bodies until she crept into the still-burning town,wrapped in her
								hooded black cloak. She was following the main road, itscobbles even and well
								maintained: a symbol in Karris’s mind of a placewell governed. A burned body lay in the
								middle of the street, facedown, onearm extended, a finger pointing deeper into the town.
								Only the hand andpointing finger were unburned. The head was missing.
							</p>

							<p>
								She hadn’t seen this kind of burn since the war. During the war, thearmies had clashed a
								number of times in areas where the bodies couldn’t beburied and where there wasn’t
								enough natural fuel for funeral pyres.Corpses had to be disposed of to avoid losing even
								more soldiers to disease,so red drafters would spray a corpse with a quick stream of red
								jelly. Aquick coating, even if drafted carelessly, could be lit quickly. Problemsolved.
								It wasn’t cremation, though. If bodies were burned singly, ratherthan in piles, the
								bones remained. If the drafter weren’t thorough, certainbody parts wouldn’t be reduced
								entirely to bone. Rib cages and skulls endedup full of smoking meat—good enough for
								exigencies of war when you hadto dispose of your opponents’ corpses to avoid spreading
								disease, but nevergood enough for one’s own countrymen.
							</p>

							<p>
								King Garadul hadn’t fought in that war, but he was aping the worstpractices of it—on his
								own people.
							</p>

							<p>
								As she suspected, that pointing hand led Karris to more bodies. At firstthey were spread
								widely, then one every thirty paces, one every twentypaces, one every ten. All were
								headless. Then bodies lined the sides of themain road now in a solid row, past smoking,
								crumbled homes and shops.The nicely maintained cobblestones here had cracked from the
								heat. Therewere tracks across the cobbles. At first she couldn’t tell what they were,
								butas she got closer it became obvious: they were drag marks, streaks of driedblood
								perhaps a day old from the decapitated bodies being dragged from thesquare.
							</p>

							<p>
								She paused amid the smoke and gore before she rounded the corner thatwould take her to
								the town square. She drew the short sword, but didn’t puton her spectacles. If there was
								a trap, it would be here, but there wasenough red and heat for her to fight magically if
								necessary. Even if shewasn’t planning on a straight infiltration, there was no need to
								announcethat she was a drafter if she didn’t have to. When the moment came,
								she’dannounce it with fire.
							</p>

							<p>
								Karris rounded the corner.Dear Orholam.They hadn’t melted the heads. They’d preserved
								them with a blue-and-yellow luxin glaze and stacked them in the middle of the town
								square. Eyesstaring, faces mangled, blood cascading from the top to the bottom like
								achampagne pyramid at the Luxlords’ Ball. Karris had half expectedsomething like this
								from all the decapitated bodies, but expecting it wasn’tthe same as seeing it. Her
								stomach heaved. She turned and clamped her jawshut, blinking rapidly, as if her eyelids
								could scrape the horrors off her eyes.She studied the rest of the square to give her
								stomach time to settle.
							</p>

							<p>
								If Gavin had seen this, he would have killed King Garadul. Pitiless asthe sea, righteous
								as Orholam, he would have hunted down every one ofthese monsters. Whatever he had done
								during the war and before—whatever he had done to her—since the False Prism’s War, Gavin
								hadtraveled the Seven Satrapies meting out justice. He’d sunk Ilytian piratefleets
								twice, killed the bandit king of the Blue-Eyed Demons, made peacewhen war had broken out
								again between Ruthgar and the Blood Forest, andbrought the Butcher of Ru to justice.
								Other than the Tyreans, the peopleloved him. And he would have wreaked a mighty
								vengeance here, even forTyreans. He wouldn’t have stood for this.
							</p>

							<p>
								Most of the buildings were piles of rubble, smoking in the predawn gray.
							</p>

							<p>
								Here and there a single wall stood, scorched and blackened and separatedfrom its fallen
								fellows. The alcaldesa’s residence, if such it was—it was thegrandest building she’d
								seen here, with steps leading directly onto thesquare—was a total loss. The soldiers had
								flattened it; there wasn’t one rockleft sitting on another.
							</p>

							<p>
								But the square itself was immaculate. Any burnt wreckage had eitherbeen pushed into the
								streets leading here or shoveled directly into the river,whose channel bounded the
								square to the west. King Garadul had wantednothing to distract a visitor from his grisly
								trophy. Steeling herself, Karrislooked back to the pyramid of human heads. All the drag
								marks, all thebloody streaks led here. The bodies—Karris hoped they’d all already
								beenbodies by the time they came here—had all been decapitated here so thatthe pyramid
								would be as bloody as possible. This was a spectacle. KingGaradul wanted everything to
								lead to this horror.
							</p>

							<p>
								The pyramid was taller than Karris. The heads at the top, crowning thepyramid, were
								children: round-cheeked little boys and little girls with theirhair in ribbons and bows.
							</p>

							<p>
								Karris didn’t throw up. There was something about this that simply lefther cold. By
								their ages and her own, those children could have been hers.She found herself counting
								the heads. There were forty-five at the base, andthe pyramid was as wide as it was tall,
								built with mathematical precision.The children’s heads were smaller, and there was no
								way to tell if thepyramid was solid or if these heads had been stacked around the
								outside ofa smaller pyramid made of something else. Karris’s fingers moved as
								shementally moved the beads of an abacus, shuttling them left and right.
							</p>

							<p>
								If the pyramid was solid heads, there were somewhere in theneighborhood of a thousand
								heads here.
							</p>

							<p>
								Cold tingles shot over her skin, the precursor to vomiting. She lookedaway. You’re a
								spy, Karris. You have to find out everything important.Taking long, deep breaths, she
								examined the bottom corner of the pyramid,then looked edge-on at one face of the shape.
								It was made of multiple layersof different colors of luxin. King Garadul wanted this to
								last for years.Someone could attack the pyramid with a sledgehammer, and they might
								beable to crack it, but not break it open. There would be no burying theseheads or
								removing this hideous monument.
							</p>

							<p>
								The skill evident here meant King Garadul had access to a number—perhaps a large
								number—of fairly talented and skilled drafters. Bad news.Karris had heard Gavin express
								his belief that King Garadul was starting apseudo-Chromeria to train his own drafters
								away from the Chromeria’soversight. This was pretty strong evidence that Gavin was
								right.“Bastard,” Karris said. She wasn’t sure whether she meant Garadul or
							</p>

							<p>
								Gavin. How stupid was that? She was staring at a pile of heads and she wasas angry at
								Gavin as she was at the monster who’d done this? Because he’dslept with some strumpet
								during the war?
							</p>

							<p>
								Insanely, even after the great fire that had ruined everything in her lifeand killed her
								brothers, Karris had been more than half tempted to go overto Dazen’s side during that
								time. If only to hear his side of what hadhappened. Maybe Gavin had known.
							</p>

							<p>
								Or maybe it was the guilt of his illicit liaison that had caused Gavin tobreak their
								betrothal right after the war.
							</p>

							<p>
								So he was unfaithful. Welcome to the common fate of women who lovegreat men. For all you
								know, it was only one night of weakness on the eveof the last battle, some beauty
								throwing herself at him, and he didn’t say no,just once.
							</p>

							<p>
								Right. But for all I know, every night was a night of weakness.It was years ago, Karris.
								Years! How has Gavin acted in all the yearssince the war?
							</p>

							<p>
								Aside from breaking our betrothal and leaving me with nothing?How has he acted toward
								you in the last fifteen years?Decently. Damn him. Aside from lying and secrets. What had
								he said? “Idon’t expect you to understand or even believe me, but what’s in that note,
								Iswear it isn’t true.” Something about that niggled at her. Why would hecompound the
								lie?
							</p>

							<p>
								The wind shifted and blew smoke across the open square. Karriscoughed, her eyes burning.
								But just as she finished coughing, she thoughtshe heard a crack.
							</p>

							<p>
								Another crack, and then, just a block away, a chimney came crashingdown into the torched
								remains of a house. The dawn was red—a trick of thesmoke and spectrums, not a heavenly
								mirror to all the blood spilled here.
							</p>

							<p>
								Karris began searching the town, looking for survivors and surveyingthe damage. Do
								what’s right, do what’s in front of you. The town hadn’tburned easily. The buildings
								were stone, albeit with wooden supports, andthe trees were green, either from manual
								watering—the river ran rightthrough town—or from their roots reaching deep enough. But
								every singlebuilding in the town center had burned down completely. That meant
								reddrafters.
							</p>

							<p>
								They must have walked through all the buildings, spraying red luxin onevery wooden beam.
							</p>

							<p>
								Karris searched for two hours, climbing over rubble in the streets,sometimes having to
								go around whole blocks. She wrapped a wet clotharound her face, but still got
								lightheaded, coughing frequently. She foundnothing other than more corpses and a few
								mournful dogs. All the livestockhad been taken. The town church had been the site of a
								small battle. Aluxiat’s body lay decapitated like the rest, outside the doors of the
								church.Karris could imagine him denouncing the soldiers outside, trying to protectthose
								of his flock who’d sought sanctuary within the walls. Inside, shefound pruning shears,
								an ax, and knives, and a pair of cleavers, and onebroken sword, and decapitated bodies.
								And dried, burned bloodeverywhere. The beams here were seared but hadn’t caught fire.
								Eitherclumsy drafting, or religious fear, or the fact that the ironwood beams,imported
								from the deserts of southern Atash, were so old and dense.
							</p>

							<p>
								The pews, however, and the bodies had burned. Karris was in a daze,whether from inhaling
								smoke or just becoming inured to the tableau ofdeath and suffering. In the back corner
								of the church behind the stairs, shefound a young family, the father with his arms
								wrapped around the mother,who was sheltering a child. The soldiers hadn’t found these.
								They’d died ineach other’s arms from the smoke. Karris checked each of them
								carefully,feeling for the faint tremor of life at each neck. Father, dead. The mother,
								agirl not yet out of her teens, dead. Karris took the swaddled babe in herarms last, a
								boy. She prayed under her breath. But Orholam turned a deafear; there was no life in his
								tiny breast.
							</p>

							<p>
								Karris staggered. She had to get out of here. She put the dead babe downon the nearest
								table, only to see it was the altar. She careened up the mainaisle of the church, past
								smoldering pews on her left and right, images ofanother time, another sacrificed babe,
								joining the horrors before her eyes.
							</p>

							<p>
								She was almost out when the floor collapsed.
							</p>

							<p>
								Chapter 25“You need to make some choices, Kip,” Gavin said.
							</p>

							<p>
								From all he could tell, Kip had only been unconscious for seconds orminutes. It was
								still dark, the stars burning coldly overhead, the fire not yetscorching his clothes
								despite its nearness to where he’d fallen. Thestrangling red luxin mask was gone, though
								there remained a light coatingof dust, gritty and sharp on his skin.“I’ll kill you!” Kip
								said. He couldn’t trust anyone. Everyone was a liar.
							</p>

							<p>
								Everyone was just out for himself. Fear rose, and that made the anger flareas it
								sometimes did, hot and fierce and uncontrollable. He sat up, eyeslocked on the Prism’s
								face. The man looked at him coolly, unapologetic,merely curious about what Kip would do,
								ignoring his words. Kipwondered if he could conjure giant green spikes from the fire to
								impale theman.
							</p>

							<p>
								Smart, Kip. In the middle of Orholam only knows where, you’d killyour guide? For what?
								For not tolerating your peevishness?
							</p>

							<p>
								Not betrayal, Kip, a lesson. Kip shivered. He’d really thought Gavin wasgoing to kill
								him. And that was the point. He had given Gavin no choice butto show that he couldn’t be
								handled, not by a child. He was not only olderthan Kip, he was smarter, and harder, and
								more experienced, and hedemanded respect.
							</p>

							<p>
								And that was… appropriate.But that didn’t stop Kip’s shivering. If only for a few
								seconds, he’dreally thought he was dying—and there had been nothing he could do aboutit.
								But this was the one man who could show him how to never bepowerless again. This was the
								man who could teach him how to avenge hismother and Rekton. And Kip was going to sit in
								silence and stubbornness?
							</p>

							<p>
								With as much dignity as he could muster, Kip retook his seat on the log.
							</p>

							<p>
								His knees trembled, but he was able to sit without disgracing himselffurther. “Sorry,”
								he mumbled, looking away. He cleared his throat so hewouldn’t squeak. “What choices?” he
								asked.
							</p>

							<p>
								He could tell Gavin was a little surprised and pleased that Kip didn’tfight, but the man
								left it alone. “You’re my natural son, Kip. That hasconsequences. For you.” Kip was
								watching Gavin’s face closely. He saidthe words “my natural son” without a grimace,
								without even his eyestightening. Kip wondered if he’d rehearsed to be able to say that
								so blithely.Kip had seen something of what claiming his own patrimony had costGavin, and
								still the man claimed him without so much as a grimace at Kip’sgrimace-worthy existence.
								It had to be an act—who could be pleased aboutlearning that he’d fathered a bastard?—but
								it was an act for Kip’s sake.
							</p>

							<p>
								Gavin was a better man than Kip would have expected. “Being knownas my bastard has
								costs,” Gavin continued. “You haven’t been raised inprivilege, but people who resent
								those raised in privilege will resent you.You haven’t been educated, but those who have
								been will look down on youif you know less than they do. If I acknowledge you, you’ll
								attract thewrong sort of friends. Those who hate and resent me can’t often take it outon
								me, Kip, I’m too powerful, too dangerous. But they will take it out onyou. It isn’t
								fair, but that’s how it is. You’ll be under constant scrutiny, andboth your successes
								and failures will have repercussions you can’t evenguess at now. My father may choose
								not to recognize you. Others will seekto prove you’re a fraud. Others will attempt to
								use you against me. And stillothers will want to befriend you only in the hope that it
								will help them gainsome favor with me. False friendship is a poison I’d like to protect
								youfrom.”
							</p>

							<p>
								Too late for that. Kip thought of Ram: Ram who was always in charge,who always liked
								smearing Kip’s face in his own inferiority and claiming itwas friendly teasing. Ram,
								whom Isa had loved. Ram, dead, lying with anarrow in his back. “So what are my options?”
								Kip asked. “I am what I am.”
							</p>

							<p>
								Gavin rubbed the bridge of his nose. “You could go as just anotherstudent for the time
								being. Then, whenever you like, I’ll publiclyacknowledge you. You’ll have time to gain
								your bearings, to learn who yourreal friends are.”“By lying to them?”“Sometimes lies are
								most necessary with our friends,” Gavin snapped.
							</p>

							<p>
								He paused. “Look, I just wanted to give you the option—”“No, I’m sorry. I’m not—I’m not
								mad at you. My mother… Do youremember what she was like? I mean, before me?” Kip asked.
							</p>

							<p>
								Gavin’s mouth worked. He wet his lips. Then shook his head. “I don’tremember her, Kip.
								At all.”
							</p>

							<p>
								So, not exactly a love affair. Kip’s emptiness doubled. There was nofamily to belong to.
								“You’re the Prism; I guess a lot of women want to bewith you,” Kip said.“It was war,
								Kip. When you expect to die, you don’t think about theeffects your actions might have on
								others ten years on. When you’ve seenfriends die all around you, there’s something about
								making love that makesyou feel alive. There was far too much wine and spirits and no one
								whowould rein in a young hothead who had the misfortune to be the Prism. Butit’s not an
								excuse. I’m sorry, Kip. I’m sorry for what my thoughtlessnesshas cost you.”
							</p>

							<p>
								So my mother had one night with you, and she pinned her hopes on that.
							</p>

							<p>
								Kip had no doubt she’d elbowed and schemed her way past a dozen otherwomen who would
								have gladly shared the Prism’s bed. And she’d filledyears with bitterness for that?
							</p>

							<p>
								Kip forced a laugh, his heart breaking. For all the times he’d dreamedabout who his
								father might be, he’d never dared to dream that he might bethe Prism himself. But in his
								dreams, his father had been called away bysome emergency. He’d left them because he had
								to. But he’d loved Kip’smother and Kip. Missed them. Wanted to come back, and would any
								day.Gavin was a good man, but he didn’t care about Lina. Or Kip. He wouldtake care of
								Kip because he was dutiful. A good person. But there was nolove. No family to belong to.
								Kip was alone, outside, staring through barredwindows at what he would never have.
							</p>

							<p>
								It was like being given a gift that was wildly exotic when you wantedsomething perfectly
								common. Still, what kind of an ingrate was he?Complaining? Feeling sorry for
								himself—because the Prism was his father?“I’m sorry,” Kip said. He stared at his
								fingernails, still torn from hisluxin use. “This isn’t right. My mother had… some
								problems. I guess shewanted to trap you by showing up with me.” Kip couldn’t maintain
								eyecontact. He was so ashamed. How could you be so stupid, mother? Somean? “You don’t
								deserve this. You saved my life, and I’ve been… awful.”Kip blinked, but he couldn’t
								fully stop the tears. “You can leave mewherever—well, preferably not on a deserted
								island.”
							</p>

							<p>
								Gavin smirked, then got serious. “Kip, your mother and I did what wedid. I appreciate
								you trying to shield me from the consequences of myactions, but you are not trapping me
								into anything. People can talk. I don’tcare. Understand?” He expelled a breath.
								“Regardless, the only damage Icare about has already been done.”
							</p>

							<p>
								For a second, Kip didn’t understand. The damage was already done? Noone even knew Kip
								was alive.
							</p>

							<p>
								Except Karris. That was what Gavin meant. Kip had caused a rift withthe only person in
								the world Gavin cared about. What had been intended tomake Kip feel better hit him
								instead where he was weakest. His mother hadmade him feel guilty for simply existing for
								as long as he could remember.He’d ruined her life by being born. He’d ruined her life by
								having too manydemands. He’d made people look down on her. He’d held her back from
								allthe things she could have done. Mentally, he could try to shrug off herwords. She
								didn’t mean it. She loved Kip, even if she had never said thewords. She didn’t know how
								she was hurting him.
							</p>

							<p>
								But Gavin was a good man. He didn’t deserve this.“Kip. Kip.” Gavin waited until Kip
								looked up at him. “I will notabandon you.”
							</p>

							<p>
								Visions of a locked cupboard, screaming—screaming—and no oneanswering. “Is there
								anything to eat?” Kip asked, blinking. “I feel like Ihaven’t eaten in a week.” He poked
								his chest. He could feel ribs stickingout.
							</p>

							<p>
								Gavin pulled a rope of sausages out of his pack, cut one off—only one?—and tossed it to
								Kip. “Tomorrow, you start at the Chromeria.”“Oomowwow?” Kip asked, mouth full.“I’m going
								to share a secret with you,” Gavin said. “I can travel fasterthan anyone suspects.”“You
								can disappear and reappear somewhere else? I knew it!” Kip said.“Um, no. But I can make
								a boat that goes really fast.”“Oh, that’s… amazing. A boat.”Gavin looked nonplussed.
								“Point is, I don’t want anyone to know howfast I am. There’s war coming, and if I need
								to unveil it, I need it to be asurprise. You understand?”“Of course,” Kip said.“Then I
								need you to tell me what you want. I’m going to go take care ofsome things while you’re
								being initiated.”“Initiated?”“Just some tests to determine the rest of your life. You’re
								late, though,all the other students have already started, so we have to hustle you
								in.After initiation, you can stay and be trained.”
							</p>

							<p>
								Kip’s throat tightened. Dropped alone on a strange island, knowing noone, and having
								little time to prepare for a test that was supposed todetermine the rest of his life? On
								the other hand, the Chromeria was wherehe’d learn the magic he needed to kill King
								Garadul. “What’s the otheroption?”“You come with me.”It was light at the end of a
								tunnel. Kip’s heart flipped. “And what areyou going to do?”“What I’m good at, Kip.”
								Gavin stared up, his irises swirling rainbows.
							</p>

							<p>
								He smiled, but it didn’t touch his eyes. When he spoke, his voice was coldand distant as
								the moon. “I’m going to make war.”
							</p>

							<p>
								Kip swallowed. Sometimes looking at Gavin, he felt like he was staringthrough trees,
								getting glimpses of a giant striding through a forest, crushingeverything in his path.
							</p>

							<p>
								Gavin turned his eyes back to Kip. His face softened. “Which mostlyinvolves boring
								meetings to convince cowards to spend money on thingsother than parties and pretty
								clothes.” He grinned. “I’m afraid you’veprobably seen more magic out of me already than
								most of my soldiers everdid.” His eyes clouded. “Well, not quite. You look
								confused.”“It’s not really about what you just said, but—” Kip stopped. It seemedlike a
								pretty offensive question, now that it was halfway out of his mouth.“What do you do?”“As
								Prism?”“Yes. Um, sir. I mean, I know you’re the emperor, but it doesn’t seemlike…”“Like
								anyone listens to me?” Gavin laughed. “Seems like it to me too.
							</p>

							<p>
								The bald truth of it is that Prisms come and go. Usually every seven years.Prisms have
								all the foibles of lesser men, and huge shifts of power everyseven years can be
								devastating. If one Prism sets up his family members togovern every satrapy, and the
								next Prism tries to set up his own in theirplaces, things get bloody fast. The Colors,
								on the other hand, the sevenmembers of the Spectrum, are often around for decades. And
								they’reusually pretty smart, so Prisms have been managed more and more overtime, given
								religious duties to fill their days. The Spectrum and the satrapsrule together. Each
								satrapy has one Color on the Spectrum, and each Coloris supposed to obey the orders of
								his or her satrap. In practice, the Colorsoften become co-satraps in all but name. The
								jockeying between Color andsatrap, and all the Colors and the White, and all the Colors
								and the Whiteagainst the Prism, pretty much keeps order. Each satrapy can do what
								itwants at home as long as it doesn’t rile up any other satrapy and trade keepsflowing,
								so everyone has an interest in keeping everyone else in check. It’snot quite that
								simple, of course, but that’s the gist.”
							</p>

							<p>
								It sounded plenty complicated enough. “But during the war…?”“I was appointed promachos.
								Absolute rule during wartime. Makeseveryone nervous, in case the promachos decides that
								the ‘war’ lastsforever.”“But you gave it up?” It was a dumb question, Kip realized.But
								Gavin smiled. “And wonder of wonders, I haven’t beenassassinated. The Blackguard doesn’t
								only protect Prisms, Kip. Theyprotect the world from us.”
							</p>

							<p>
								Orholam. Gavin’s world sounded more dangerous than what Kip hadjust left. “So you’ll
								teach me to draft?” he asked. It was the best of allworlds. He would learn what he
								needed to learn, without being set on astrange island alone. And who could teach
								drafting better than the Prismhimself?“Of course. But first there’s some things we have
								to do.”Kip looked longingly at the sausage rope Gavin still held. “Like eatmore?”
							</p>

							<p>
								Chapter 26
							</p>

							<p>
								By noon the next day, Kip had fully swallowed his teasing about a fast boat.They were
								flying across the waves at mind-boggling speed, and Gavin hadenclosed the boat,
								muttering something about that woman and her ideas, sonow, despite the speed, they could
								speak.“So you’ve used green,” Gavin said, as if it were normal for him to beleaning hard
								forward, skin entirely red, feet strapped in, hands gripping twotranslucent blue posts,
								throwing great plugs of red luxin down into thewater, sweating profusely, muscles
								knotted. “That’s a good color. Everyoneneeds green drafters.”“I think I can see heat,
								too. And Master Danavis said I’m asuperchromat.”“What?”“Master Danavis was the dyer in
								town. Sometimes I’d help him. He hadtrouble matching the reds as well as the alcaldesa’s
								husband liked.”“Corvan Danavis? Corvan Danavis lived in Rekton?”“Y-yes.”“Slender, about
								forty, beaded mustache, couple freckles, and some red inhis hair?”“No mustache,” Kip
								said. “But, otherwise.”Gavin swore quietly.“You know our dyer?” Kip asked,
								incredulous.“You could say that. He fought against me in the war. I’m more curiousabout
								you seeing heat. Tell me what you do.”“Master Danavis taught me to look at the edges of
								my vision.
							</p>

							<p>
								Sometimes when I do, people glow, especially their bare skin, armpits,and… you
								know.”“Groin?”“Right.” Kip cleared his throat.“Blind me,” Gavin said. He chuckled.“What?
								What’s that mean?”“We’ll see later.”“Later? Like what, a year or two? Why do all adults
								talk to me like I’mstupid?”“Fair enough. Unless you’re truly freakish, you’re likely a
								discontiguousbichrome.”
							</p>

							<p>
								Kip blinked. A what what? “I said I’m not stupid; ignorant’s different.”“And I meant
								later today,” Gavin said.“Oh.”“There are two special cases in drafting—well, there are
								lots of specialcases. Orholam’s great bloody—I’ve never tried to teach the early
								stuff.Have you ever wondered if you were the only real person in the world,
								andeverything and everyone else was just your imagination?”
							</p>

							<p>
								Kip blushed. Back home, he’d even tried to stop imagining Ram, hopingthe boy would
								simply cease to exist. “I guess so.”“Right, it’s one of a puerile mind’s first
								flirtations with egoism. Nooffense.”“None taken.” Since I have no idea what you just
								said.“It’s attractive because it validates your own importance, allows you todo whatever
								the hell you want, and it can’t be disproven. Teaching draftingruns into the same
								problem. I’m going to assume here that you do acceptthat other people exist.”“Sure. I’m
								not much for lecturing myself,” Kip said. He grinned.Gavin squinted at the horizon. He’d
								rigged up two lenses separated byan arm’s length and mounted on the luxin canopy so he
								could scan the seas.He must have seen something, because he banked the skimmer hard
								left—port! Hard to port.
							</p>

							<p>
								When he turned back, he’d apparently missed Kip’s quip.“Anyway, where were we? Ah. The
								problem with teaching drafting isthat color exists—it’s separate from us—but we only
								know it through ourexperience of it. We don’t know why, but some
								men—subchromats—can’tdifferentiate between red and green. Other subchromats can’t
								differentiatebetween blue and yellow. Obviously, when you tell a man that he can’t see
								acolor he’s never seen, he might not believe you. Everyone else who tellshim red and
								green are different colors could be just playing a cruel joke onhim. Or he must accept
								the existence of something he’ll never see. Thereare theological implications, but I’ll
								spare you. To make it simple, if thereare color-deficient men—incidentally, it is almost
								always men—why couldthere not also be those who are extremely color-sensitive,
								superchromats?And it turns out there are. But they’re almost always women. In fact,
								abouthalf of women can differentiate between colors at an extreme level. Formen, it’s
								one in tens of thousands.”“Wait, so men lose both ways? Blind to colors more often and
								reallygood at seeing them less often? That’s not fair.”“But we can lift heavy
								things.”Kip grumbled. “And pee standing up, right?”“Very useful around poison ivy. I was
								on a mission with Karris this onetime…” Gavin whistled.“She didn’t,” Kip said,
								horrified.“You thought she was mad at me back on the river? Somehow, it wasmy fault that
								time, too.” Gavin grinned. “Anyway, to wend my way back tomy point, most of us can see
								the normal range of colors. Hmm, tautologythere.”“What?” Kip asked.“That’s a digression
								too far. Just because you can see a color doesn’tmean you can draft it. But if you can’t
								see a color, you’ll draft it poorly. Somen aren’t as accurate when drafting certain
								colors as superchromatwomen, which is half of them. Will can cover a lot of mistakes,
								but it’sbetter if there aren’t mistakes to begin with. This becomes vital if
								you’retrying to build a luxin building that won’t fall down.”“They make luxin
								buildings?”Gavin ignored him. “The special cases that I started all this to tell
								youabout are sub-red and superviolet. If you can see heat, Kip, there’s a goodchance you
								can draft it.”“You mean I can start a fire like whoosh?!” Kip made a grand
								sweepinggesture.“Only if you say ‘whoosh!’ when you do it.” Gavin laughed.Kip blushed
								again, but Gavin’s laughter wasn’t mocking. It didn’t makehim feel stupid, just silly.
								There was plenty scary about the man, like
							</p>

							<p>
								Master Danavis was scary sometimes. But neither seemed mean. Neitherseemed bad.“And that
								would be very strange,” Gavin said, “because you’ve draftedgreen.” He looked like he was
								trying to figure out how to teach something.“Have you ever seen a rainbow?”“A
								rain-what?” Kip asked, doe-eyed.“It was a rhetorical question, smarty. The order of
								colors is superviolet,blue, green, yellow, orange, red, sub-red. Usually, a bichrome
								simply spansa broader arc. So they draft superviolet and blue, or blue and green, or
								greenand yellow. A polychrome—much rarer—might draft green, yellow, andorange. A drafter
								who drafts colors that don’t border each other is rare.Karris is one. She drafts green,
								but not yellow, not orange, and then shedrafts most of red and into sub-red.”“So she’s a
								polychrome.”“Close. Karris can’t quite draft sustainable sub-red—what they call afire
								crystal. Fire crystals don’t last long regardless because they react to air,but—never
								mind that. Point is, she’s just short of being a polychrome, andthat matters.”“I bet
								that made her happy,” Kip said.“On the bright side, they wouldn’t have let her become a
								Blackguard ifshe was a polychrome—polychromes are too valuable—and the pressure onher to
								bear children would have increased. Regardless, it’s rare, and it’scalled being a
								discontiguous bichrome. Discontiguous because the arcsaren’t touching. Bichrome because
								there are two. See? Everything indrafting is logical. Except what isn’t. Like so: seeing
								sub-red is seeing heat,so seeing superviolet should be seeing cold, right?”“Right.”“But
								it isn’t.”“Oh,” Kip said. “Well, that makes sense, I guess.” Except that it doesn’t.“I
								have the strongest urge to ruffle your hair,” Gavin said.Kip grunted. “So how is this
								going to work?”“There’s a small island we use as an artillery station. There’s a
								tunnelbetween there and the Chromeria, which is a secret so important that if youtell
								anyone, the Chromeria will hunt you down and execute you.” He said itcheerfully, but Kip
								had no doubt that he was serious.“Then why did you just tell me?” Kip asked. “I could
								let it slip.”“Because I’ve already shared a secret that I think is more
								important—theexistence of this skimmer. But if you betray that secret to our enemies,
								theChromeria might do nothing. But if you do betray us deliberately, you’dalso tell them
								about the escape tunnel. So now if you betray me, you’llbetray the whole Chromeria too.
								And they’ll come after you and they’ll killyou.”
							</p>

							<p>
								Kip felt a chill. This man was warm, personable. Kip had no doubt that
							</p>

							<p>
								Gavin liked him, but in Gavin’s circles, you could like someone and stillhave to kill
								him. The casual way that Gavin prepared for Kip’s possiblebetrayal told Kip he’d been
								betrayed before and been caught unaware by it.And Gavin wasn’t the kind of man who had
								to learn a hard lesson twice.“I’m going to dock on the island and put you on a boat to
								the mainisland. I’ll send a Blackguard with you to take you to the Thresher. In a
								fewdays, you’ll leave with me wherever I decide we have to go and I’ll startteaching you
								to draft.”
							</p>

							<p>
								Kip hardly heard the last part, though. “The Thresher?”
							</p>

							<p>
								Chapter 27
							</p>

							<p>
								Karris only fell a few feet through the floor before she hit something soft.Her left
								foot sank to the knee while the rest of her body continued fallinginto the basement. The
								sticky whatever-it-was held her leg as she fell, soshe swung upside down and the rest of
								her slapped into the side ofsomething like a great red egg—a thin crust over gooey
								innards. Shesmacked into it, broke the side, and splatted into red luxin. Then her
								fallpulled her free and she fell onto a stone floor.
							</p>

							<p>
								As she’d been trained, she flung her right hand down hard, the shock ofslapping the
								floor hurt her hand—it always hurt—but that slap took thepressure off more vulnerable
								areas of her body and allowed her to guide thelast part of her fall. She rolled instead
								of landing on her head.
							</p>

							<p>
								In a moment, she popped up to her feet, and pulled the thin-hiltedataghan from her pack.
								There was no light in the chamber except whatspilled down through the hole she’d made in
								the ceiling. Chunks of woodwere still falling into the hole. The great red egg shone in
								the sudden light.Settling smoke, stirred by Karris’s fall, climbed the shaft of
								lightsurrounding the egg. The entire room, perhaps twenty paces by thirty, stankof smoke
								and burnt red luxin, which was odd, because red luxin usuallyburned perfectly cleanly.
								For that matter, every surface illuminated in theweak light appeared to be blackened
								luxin as well.
							</p>

							<p>
								But the great egg took all of Karris’s attention. At least seven feet tall, itwas seared
								perfectly black except where Karris had broken it. Red luxinnow oozed out of that wound
								like tar. A half dozen tubes snaked away fromthe egg in every direction, disappearing
								into the ceiling, each alsoblackened. The seared corpses of a dozen of King Garadul’s
								soldiers layabout the room.“What in the hell?” Karris murmured. She lifted her sword to
								crack theegg open.
							</p>

							<p>
								The egg exploded before she could touch it. A great section of the frontflew into her,
								the blackened shell shattering over her barely raised left arm,her chest, stomach, and
								legs. Caught in midstep, she was thrown offbalance. She stumbled and felt more than saw
								a form shooting backwardout of the egg even as the shell splattered over her.
							</p>

							<p>
								Instead of trying to catch herself, Karris flung herself into the fall. Sherolled
								forward, tucking her ataghan in so she didn’t skewer herself, andattacked. There was no
								hesitation. Ironfist had pounded that lesson intoKarris for years: when attacked, you
								counterattack instantly. The speed ofthat strike was often the only advantage you had.
								Especially if you weresmall. Especially if you were a woman. Especially if you weren’t
								wearingyour spectacles and the other drafter was.
							</p>

							<p>
								Karris’s attacker had backed all the way up to the wall. He stood withliving coils of
								red luxin like giant knots around his hands. Karris knew thatconstruction. If you knew
								what you were doing, you could hold extra openluxin outside your body. Those knots of
								open luxin could be formed intoanything you wanted and, held on your hands, you could
								actually fling themhowever you needed. The man stood like a trained fighter, too: left
								sidetoward Karris, left hand up to block but still with some springiness to throwout an
								attack, right hand higher and pulled back, right knee bent deeply,holding most of his
								weight. Even with Karris’s speed with drafting and theamount of red luxin here to
								reflect red light to her eyes, it still took sometime to ready an attack, and he had the
								drop on her. Her only hope was toclose the distance between them before he killed her.
							</p>

							<p>
								His left hand flicked out, right to left, low. Red luxin glommed on thefloor to slow
								her. She was expecting it, and she stutter-stepped over thesticky patches. His right
								hand snapped forward in three sharp jerks. Threeballs, each the size of a fist, whipped
								out right to left. Karris dodged thefirst and second, but the third caught her as she
								had to stutter-step again tomiss another sticky patch on the floor. It thumped hard into
								the ribs on herleft side, then splattered. She rolled with it, spun into range, and
								slashedwith the ataghan.
							</p>

							<p>
								The red drafter met her descending sword with layer after layer of redluxin. Held luxin,
								even red luxin, could gain a certain degree of rigidityfrom the drafter’s will, and more
								from being woven, but red luxin couldnever stop steel. It was like pitting water against
								a sword.
							</p>

							<p>
								But this wasn’t just a bit of held red luxin. It wasn’t like slapping asword into still
								water. It was like standing below a dam when they openedthe floodgates. It was only
								water, but the speed and volume of it wouldblow a man off his feet. Likewise, the red
								luxin hitting Karris slowed her,slowed her more, and finally brought her to a complete
								halt.
							</p>

							<p>
								The red drafter’s face paled as the luxin drained out of him. Next, hisneck and chest
								went back to their natural hue as the torrent continued. Thenhis muscular shoulders, the
								luxin being bleached out of his body from eyesto extremities. They both realized he was
								running out of luxin at the sametime.
							</p>

							<p>
								Karris broke off her attack at the same time he did. She feinted to hisright, expecting
								to meet more red luxin, and set up a killing blow. Instead,her sword clanged against
								something hard, but she didn’t see any sword. Hecouldn’t have drawn one without her
								seeing it, not even in this darkness.
							</p>

							<p>
								Not hesitating, she lifted the ataghan and brought it down toward hishead. It clanged
								and stopped as he lifted his hands in a V.
							</p>

							<p>
								He shoved her hard backward and followed, keeping close. The shaft oflight piercing the
								gloom of the room illuminated his hands and what he washolding as he shouted, “Enough!
								Damn you, stop for one second.”
							</p>

							<p>
								The drafter held a pistol in each hand, crossed, their barrels holding
							</p>

							<p>
								Karris’s ataghan prisoner between them. His right pistol stared at her righteye, his
								left at her left eye. Karris had her other knives and the bich’hwa, ofcourse, but there
								was no way she could draw any of them before he couldpull a trigger.
							</p>

							<p>
								The pistols staring at her were of Ilytian design. The Ilytian renunciationof magic
								usually meant their mundane tools were the best. With pistols,however, it was still
								dicey. This drafter had wheellock pistols. They negatedthe need to keep a fuse burning,
								but the flints failed to ignite the blackpowder at least one time in four.
							</p>

							<p>
								Unfortunately, both pistols were double-barreled, and all four hammerswere raised.
								Karris tried to do the figures—was it one time in sixteen or onetime in two hundred
								fifty-six that all four shots would fail? Her heartdespaired. She wasn’t going to gamble
								on those odds, not even one insixteen.
							</p>

							<p>
								So… talking.“What do you draft?” the man demanded, his voice strained.“I don’t know what
								you’re talking—”“What. Do. You. Draft?!” he screamed. He flung her ataghan aside andput
								one pistol directly against her forehead. It was too dark for him to seeher irises, but
								he was going to figure out soon, anyway, so Karris said,“Green. Green and red.”“Then
								draft a ladder and get out. Now!”Another time, Karris might have been irked that she
								obeyed so promptly,but her spectacles were on her face in an instant and she turned
								toward thelight. Everything in this chamber was covered with either open red luxin
								orblackened, seared, closed red luxin. Finally, she found an ironwood beamup in the
								temple that reflected a pure enough white light to allow her todraft a good solid green.
							</p>

							<p>
								Even as her body filled with green, she saw why the drafter was sourgent. This chamber
								was filled with red luxin. She shouldn’t have put ittogether so slowly. There were two
								entrances to the room, and the deadsoldiers were seared but not roasted to death—and the
								red luxin hadremained, coating everything rather than burning as it should have.
							</p>

							<p>
								And it still remained. This room was full of red luxin, old and new. Theywere inside a
								powder keg.
							</p>

							<p>
								A burning pew fell over, spilling smoldering and flaming brands towardthe hole. One
								tottered on the edge, promising death.
							</p>

							<p>
								Karris ran forward, throwing down green luxin thick enough to stand on.
							</p>

							<p>
								She drafted what was effectively an impossibly narrow staircase, the stepsonly wide
								enough to hold her feet, only strong enough to hold her weight ifshe concentrated her
								will. But it only had to last for two seconds while shesprinted out—and it did. She
								stepped, stepped, stepped, fleet-footed as ahind, and vaulted, landing on the church
								floor. She felt a bit of the floorgive way to drop into the chamber below, so she rolled
								again and keptrunning for the open front door. That much red luxin in the basement
								meantthe whole thing could—
							</p>

							<p>
								Whoomp!The explosion made the floor jump beneath Karris’s feet. It hit just asshe was
								pushing off of a step, and it flung her like a spring. The yawningopen doors of the
								church yawned wider and she was lifted and thrownforward. For a moment she thought she
								would make it through them and beflung harmlessly outside, but she’d been lifted high by
								the explosion—toohigh. The ironwood frame above the door loomed. Then her upper
								bodysmashed into it, and through it. The burned, weakened ironwood gave wayafter only an
								instant, but the instant it held was long enough for her to bespun viciously, upside
								down, flipping so fast she didn’t even know howmany times she tumbled.
							</p>

							<p>
								Then she was skidding on cobblestones and gravel, not sure if she’dblacked out for a
								second or exactly how she’d come to the ground.
							</p>

							<p>
								She turned over, ignoring the just-starting screams of protest from all toomuch of her
								body, and looked toward the mangled front door of the church.
							</p>

							<p>
								A gigantic crimson snake, all aflame, stabbed its head out the front door.
							</p>

							<p>
								No, not a snake, a tube of pure red luxin, afire, the width of a man’sshoulders. Then
								the serpent vomited, and just a little faster than fire couldcurl up the flammable red
								luxin, the drafter was shot clear of church andfire and luxin alike.
							</p>

							<p>
								He landed not far from Karris, and far more gracefully, rolling to bleedoff speed, and
								finally standing. He scanned the streets on every side and,seeing no one, only then
								allowed himself to relax a little. But once he did,Karris could see the bone-deep
								weariness steal over him. Drafting as muchmagic as she’d just seen left him looking
								about as bad as she felt, deathlypale and tottering on his feet.“Come on,” the drafter
								said. “I think Garadul’s soldiers are all gone, butif not, they’ll be here soon after
								what you just did. We need to go.”
							</p>

							<p>
								Karris stood, wobbled, and would have fallen if he hadn’t grabbed her.“Who are you?”“I’m
								Corvan Danavis,” the drafter said. “And if I don’t misremember,you’re Karris White Oak,
								aren’t you?”“Danavis?” she asked. Orholam how she hurt. “You were Dazen’s. Arebel. I can
								make it on my own, thank you.” She shrugged off his help,leaned crazily to one side,
								then the other, and finally collapsed. He watched,arms folded, and didn’t catch her. Her
								shoulder hit the ground and the worldswam.
							</p>

							<p>
								Karris saw Corvan’s boots come close. He was probably going to leaveher here for the
								soldiers. She deserved it, too. Stupid, stubborn girl.

								Chapter 28
							</p>

							<p>
								The dory Gavin drafted while they were still five leagues from Little JasperIsland was
								modeled on one he’d seen an Abornean wild drafter use, withhigh sides and a flat bottom,
								a pointed prow, and a flat bow plate. It wassafer and far less efficient than the sculls
								Gavin preferred, but that was thepoint. Not many drafters dared to use a scull on the
								ocean, because if youwere going to use a scull on the ocean, you had to be willing to
								fall in thewater. That meant being confident of getting out of the water solely
								bydrafting, and not many drafters had the skill or the will to swim in roughseas and
								draft at the same time.
							</p>

							<p>
								Gavin’s skill—or recklessness—meant his usual silhouette on the opensea was instantly
								recognizable. He didn’t want that. Thus the dory.
							</p>

							<p>
								Kip was sulking, nervous about the Thresher and Gavin’s refusal to tellhim anything
								about it.
							</p>

							<p>
								Within a couple of leagues, they passed two merchant galleys and agalleass. Each time, a
								mate inspected them through a spyglass, saw Gavin’smuddled clothes and no distress
								flags, and rowed past without a word.There was little wind today, so the sailors got to
								rest while galley slavesmanned their banks of oars. Each time he encountered another
								ship, Gavinwaved gamely when the spyglass came out, and returned to his own oars.
							</p>

							<p>
								What people called the Chromeria was really two islands: Little Jasper,covered entirely
								by the Chromeria itself, and Big Jasper, home toembassies, merchants’ estates, shops,
								stalls, taverns, brothels, prisons,flophouses, tenements, warehouses, rope makers, sail
								makers, oar turners,fishermen, convict slaves, and far more than its fair share of
								graspers,schemers, and dreamers.
							</p>

							<p>
								Big Jasper had two large natural harbors, one on the east that providednatural
								protection during the dark season, and one on the west for the lightseason, when the
								storms came from the east. As the island had grown inpopulation and importance,
								breakwaters had been built on each side so bothharbors could be used year-round. After
								several occupations, which hadnever touched the Chromeria but had purged Big Jasper in
								fire and blood, awall had been built to encircle the entire island. Thirty paces thick
								andtwenty high, it was now used mostly by the city’s runners to spot and stopcrimes in
								the streets below.
							</p>

							<p>
								Gavin’s business was on Little Jasper, but he couldn’t dock in its single,smaller harbor
								without being seen by spies from every one of the SevenSatrapies. Even Tyrea would have
								a spy watching those who were importantenough to dock there directly. So he rowed them
								between the two islands.Between the jaws of Little Jasper’s U-shaped harbor was Cannon
								Island.Only twenty men were garrisoned there at any time, and there were alwaystwo
								drafters on duty, ostensibly because of the hazards of docking on theisland when there
								was anything more than the gentlest tide and lightestwind. It was a loathed posting, and
								one from which not even theBlackguards escaped. It was thought that the White kept the
								rolls restrictedto higher-ranked Chromeria guards in order to be able to teach humility
								to acertain class of men and women who tended to be a little more brash thanwas good for
								themselves.
							</p>

							<p>
								And indeed, the White and the Black did use postings to Cannon Islandas punishment, but
								only for trusted soldiers. The fiction worked better if itwas half true. When other
								soldiers traded postings—I’ll take your CannonIsland post next week if you’ll just take
								my rounds this next weekend—thewatch commander noted the names of anyone who switched.
								Those werethen watched carefully while they were on duty, and more carefullyafterward.
								Spies had certainly infiltrated the island, which was strategicallyimportant for purely
								mundane reasons, but none had yet—the Whitebelieved—penetrated Cannon Island’s real
								importance.
							</p>

							<p>
								Amid the crashing waves of high tide, Gavin brought the dory aroundthe back of the
								island. With his drafted multitude of oars, he had far greatercontrol than he would have
								had over a mundane boat, but it was still trickybusiness to line up with the rollers
								erected long ago so boats could be pulledclear of even storm-height waves. They’d been
								seen, of course, and two
							</p>

							<p>
								Blackguards—Blackguards were always given the boat duty—greetedthem.
							</p>

							<p>
								The men, imposing brothers with coal-black skin, recognized Gavininstantly. Each held up
								a hand—not in greeting, but to give Gavin a stabletarget. He aimed superviolet at each
								hand, stuck it there, and then flung acoil of green luxin along that stable thread. Like
								rope, the luxin stuck ineach big man’s hand. Gavin fastened the other ends directly to
								the boat withtwo small globs of red luxin. The men pulled him in expertly. The
								doryrattled as it settled awkwardly from the waves onto the rollers and thenslipped
								smoothly up the ramp.
							</p>

							<p>
								Commander Ironfist, the elder brother, spoke first, as always: “Sir.” Hiseyes flicked
								down to Gavin’s tattered clothes. The “sir” was his laconicequivalent of, Of course I
								recognize you, but if this is supposed to be adisguise, I’m smart enough not to ruin it.
								What do you want us to call youtoday?“I’ll need a Blackguard to take Kip to the
								Chromeria, Commander. I’vetold him about the escape tunnel, by the by, so keep an eye on
								him.”
							</p>

							<p>
								Both men absorbed that in displeased silence.“We’ll need to wait until low tide for—”
								Tremblefist began.“Immediately,” Gavin said, not raising his voice. “He’s to be put
								throughthe Thresher. No rush, tomorrow will be fine. Report the results to theWhite.
								Tell her Kip is my… nephew.”
							</p>

							<p>
								Ironfist’s eyebrow twitched, and Tremblefist’s eyes widened. Kip, on theother hand,
								looked stricken.
							</p>

							<p>
								Gavin looked at the boy, but Kip seemed suddenly shy.“I’ll see you tomorrow,” Gavin
								said. “You’ll do fine. After all, you’vegot my blood.” He smirked.
							</p>

							<p>
								Kip looked baffled. “You mean you’re not… saying I’m not your, um,bastard?” Kip himself
								looked confused with all the negatives.“No no no. I’m not disavowing you! When I say
								‘nephew,’ everyoneknows what it means. It’s just more polite. And it pays to be polite
								wherethe White is involved.”
							</p>

							<p>
								Ironfist coughed. He could cough quite pointedly.Gavin looked at him pointedly in
								return. Ironfist adjusted his ghotra, hischeckered Parian headscarf, as if
								oblivious.“But how do people know I’m not really your nephew?” Kip asked. Hewas still
								clutching the luxin oar Gavin had drafted for him.“Because they’ll pause like it’s
								delicate, and not say your surname. ‘Thisis Kip, the Lord Prism’s… nephew.’ Not, ‘This
								is Kip Guile, the LordPrism’s nephew.’ You see?”
							</p>

							<p>
								Kip swallowed. “Yes, sir.”Gavin looked across the waves to the Prism’s tower. He hated
								beinggone overnight. His room slave Marissia would dye the bread and throw itin the
								chute for the prisoner, and he knew he could trust her. But that wasdifferent from doing
								it himself. He looked back to the frightened boy.“Do me proud, Kip.”
							</p>

							<p>
								Chapter 29
							</p>

							<p>
								Kip watched the Prism head out across the waves with something akin topanic. Gavin was
								so in control of everything, so fearless, and now he’d lefthim. With two unfriendly
								giants.
							</p>

							<p>
								As Gavin finally disappeared from sight, Kip turned to look at the men.
							</p>

							<p>
								The scarier one, Ironfist, was putting on blue spectacles with large ovallenses wrapped
								close to his eyes. As Kip watched, the blue luxin filled theman, but it was almost
								invisible against his coal-black skin. The whites ofhis eyes already looked blue when
								you saw them through the blue lenses, soit wasn’t until the skin under his fingernails
								turned icy blue that Kip wassure he hadn’t just imagined the Blackguard was drafting at
								all.“Grab a rope,” Ironfist told his brother. “With the float on it.”
							</p>

							<p>
								Tremblefist disappeared, leaving Kip with his brother.“I don’t know why you’ve been
								trusted with this island’s secret,”
							</p>

							<p>
								Ironfist said, “even if you are his… nephew. But now that you know, you’rea guardian of
								it like the rest of us, you understand?”“He did it so if I betray him men like you will
								come kill me for him,”
							</p>

							<p>
								Kip said. Was he never able to keep his mouth shut?
							</p>

							<p>
								A look of surprise flitted across Ironfist’s face, and was quickly replacedwith
								amusement. “A deep thinker, our friend,” he said. “And a young manwith ice water in his
								veins. How appropriate.”
							</p>

							<p>
								From the “our friend,” Kip understood that they weren’t even to say the
							</p>

							<p>
								Prism’s name here, not even now, with the wind whipping around them andthe possibility
								of eavesdropping nil. It was that kind of secret.“The story is you and your master, a
								scribe, came out on a friend’s boatto… hmm.”“To study some local fish?” Kip asked.“Good
								enough,” Ironfist said. “He didn’t account for the waves and hadno skill with boats. He
								tried to bring you here for shelter. Your dorycapsized and he was lost. We pulled you
								out of the sea.”“Oh, to account for why he isn’t here if any of the others saw us
								comingin,” Kip said.“That’s right. Hold tight.”Kip was holding a luxin oar up between
								himself and Ironfist, but healmost didn’t get what the big man meant until too late.
								With a quick,snapping punch, Ironfist lashed a hand through the luxin and stopped it
								soclose that Kip flinched. He barely even noticed the luxin crumbling to dustin his
								fingers. He had a sudden urge to urinate.“I don’t know if you’ve given your sire reason
								to suspect you,” Ironfistsaid. “But if you betray him, I’ll tear your arms off and beat
								you withthem.”“Good thing I’m fat, then,” Kip shot back.“What?” Incredulous.“Soft arms.”
								Kip grinned, thinking Ironfist had been kidding. The stony,flat, willing-to-kill look on
								the big man’s face made Kip’s grin break anddisintegrate like broken luxin.“That fat’ll
								make you float, too. Get in the water,” a cold voice behindhim said.
							</p>

							<p>
								Kip flinched. He hadn’t even heard Tremblefist approach. The man wascarrying a hollow
								log with numerous knotted ropes and loops attached. Thewood was carved with several
								handles too, so it would be easy to throw intothe sea. A swimmer could then grab for
								whatever length of rope he needed.
							</p>

							<p>
								Tremblefist handed the log to Kip and Ironfist rang a loud bell. “Manoverboard!”
								Ironfist shouted. “We’ve got two in the water!”“Move it,” Tremblefist said. “And you’d
								better get completely wet. Fast.
							</p>

							<p>
								Help will be here in seconds.”
							</p>

							<p>
								Kip clutched the hollow log and jogged down the ramp between therollers. The first big
								wave knocked him cleanly off his feet. His headsmacked one of the great wooden rollers
								and he saw stars. Then the waterwas over him.
							</p>

							<p>
								The water was shockingly cold at first. It was a cold that you quickly gotused to—the
								Cerulean Sea was fairly warm—but Kip didn’t have moments.He gasped and inhaled salt
								water as another wave passed over him. As hecoughed his lungs clear, flapping his arms
								like an injured bird, he could feelthe riptide grab him. Where was the log? He’d lost
								it. It was gone.
							</p>

							<p>
								Someone was shouting, but he couldn’t hear what they were saying overthe crash of the
								waves. The swells were only a pace high, but it was enoughto blot out Kip’s vision. He
								turned in a circle.
							</p>

							<p>
								There was a bell ringing, ringing. Kip turned toward it, and despite theswells, he could
								see the looming black of Cannon Island. It was stillreceding. He started swimming. A
								wave pummeled him, drove him underthe water and spun him. He kicked, kicked, trying not
								to panic. Failing. Hehad no air. Orholam, he was going to die. He kicked, desperate.
							</p>

							<p>
								He bobbed to the surface like a cork, but he was lost once more.His panic receded. He’d
								floundered somehow to the side of the riptide,and now the waves were bringing him in
								toward Cannon Island, but nottoward the boat ramp. He was headed for the rocks. He swam
								hardsideways toward the sound of the bell.
							</p>

							<p>
								He was rising with one of the swells when he saw somethingimpossible. Ironfist, with a
								rope tied around his chest, was running—through the air. He was wearing blue spectacles,
								and both of his hands werepointed down. He was hurling blue luxin toward his feet,
								sprinting, makinga platform to stand on even as he ran.
							</p>

							<p>
								As Kip watched, the blue luxin platform—anchored only somewhereback on Cannon
								Island—cracked with a report and began to crash towardthe waves. Ironfist leapt as the
								platform fell, releasing the luxin andexecuting a perfect dive.
							</p>

							<p>
								He surfaced right next to Kip, his spectacles and ghotra ripped off by thewaves, and
								grabbed Kip with one arm. Then the men on the beach beganpulling in the rope as fast as
								they could. In less than a minute, Kip and thebig man were staggering up the ramp. Well,
								Ironfist was striding, one handholding a fistful of Kip’s shirt in case he fell, and Kip
								was staggering onjellied, naked legs.“We couldn’t save your master, son. I’m sorry,”
								Ironfist said. There werea dozen soldiers crowded on the narrow portico outside the back
								door ofCannon Island. One threw a blanket over Kip’s shoulders. “Take this youngman
								inside and take care of him,” Ironfist commanded. “I’ve got businesson Big Jasper, I’ll
								take him with me and notify the family. Ten minutes.”
							</p>

							<p>
								As the soldiers ushered Kip inside, he heard Ironfist swear quietly,“Damn, those were my
								best blue specs.”
							</p>

							<p>
								Chapter 30
							</p>

							<p>
								Liv Danavis walked briskly over the luxin bridge called the Lily’s Stem thatconnected
								the Chromeria on Little Jasper Island to the markets and homeson Big Jasper Island,
								trying to ignore the tension knotting her shoulders.She was wearing rough linen pants, a
								cloak against the chilly wind of thebright morning, her dark hair pulled back in a
								ponytail, and the samesensible low leather shoes she’d worn when she’d first come to
								theChromeria as a terrified fourteen-year-old. She always felt the temptation todress up
								in her nicest things when she was summoned, but she alwaysresisted. Her rich, imperious
								handler would make her feel shabby no matterwhat she wore, so she might as well be
								defiant. If Dazen Guile had won thePrisms’ War, Liv would be Lady Aliviana Danavis, the
								daughter of thecelebrated general Corvan Danavis. Being Tyrean would have been a badgeof
								honor. She wouldn’t have owed anyone anything. But Dazen had beenkilled, and those who
								sided with him disgraced, her own father narrowlyavoiding execution despite being held
								in higher esteem than any general oneither side. So now she was plain old Liv Danavis
								from Rekton, the dyer’sdaughter. And Ruthgar owned her contract. So what? She wasn’t
								scared ofbeing summoned.
							</p>

							<p>
								Much.Despite having been on the Jasper Islands for the last three years, Livhadn’t come
								over to Big Jasper very often. The other girls came every weekto listen to minstrels,
								get food not made in the Chromeria kitchens, meetboys who weren’t drafters, shop, and
								drink too much after examinations.Liv couldn’t afford any of those, and didn’t want to
								ask charity of anyone,so she begged off, always saying she needed to practice or to
								study.
							</p>

							<p>
								The benefit of that was that she wasn’t yet jaded to the wonders of Big
							</p>

							<p>
								Jasper. The entire island was stuffed with buildings, but nothing washaphazard, unlike
								back home or in Garriston. The buildings were whitestucco, blindingly bright in the sun,
								rising in terraces with the shape of theland. Geometric shapes dominated: hexagonal
								buildings and octagonalbuildings topped with domes. Every building large enough to
								justify one—and many that weren’t—sported a dome, and the domes were every color inthe
								rainbow. Blue domes the color of the Cerulean Sea, beaten gold domeson the homes of the
								rich, copper domes turning gradually green andscrubbed every year to gleam again at Sun
								Day, domes painted the color ofblood, mirrored domes. And with the domes, the doors,
								too, were beautiful.It was as if all the irrepressible personality of the Jasperites
								rebelled againstthe conformity of their white walls and similar-shaped homes, but only
								inthe decorating and designing of their doors. Exotic woods, chiseled patternsfrom every
								corner of the Seven Satrapies and beyond, doors apparentlycarved of living wood with
								leaves still growing from the Tree People,Tyrean horseshoe arches, Parian chessboard
								patterns, huge doors to smallbuildings, keyhole doors in huge edifices.
							</p>

							<p>
								But at least as iconic as the colored domes and shining white walls of
							</p>

							<p>
								Big Jasper were the Thousand Stars. Every street was laid out perfectlystraight, and at
								every intersection stood pairs of narrow arches, thin, lookingimpossibly spindly on
								their white legs, at least ten stories tall, connectinghigh above the intersection in a
								groin vault. Mounted on swivels at thepinnacle of the groin vault was a circular mirror,
								highly polished, flawless,as tall as a man. With the special layout of the streets, as
								soon as the sunconquered the horizon, light could be directed anywhere.
							</p>

							<p>
								Long ago the builders had said, In this city, there will be no shadow that
							</p>

							<p>
								Orholam’s eye cannot touch. Day was longer on Big Jasper than anywherein the world.
							</p>

							<p>
								The original purpose, as near as Liv could guess, had been to extend thepower of
								drafters on the island. In other densely populated cities, thebuildings eventually
								crowded out the sun. Not only did that make a city feeldark, but it meant drafters
								walking down those streets were vulnerable. Thebuildings here were separated carefully
								according to height and width,leaving lightwells, but with the Thousand Stars, a drafter
								could have asmuch power available to her as she could handle for hours longer than
								shewould otherwise.
							</p>

							<p>
								On Sun Day, every one of the Thousand Stars was slaved to the Prism.
							</p>

							<p>
								Everywhere he walked, every mirror turned, illuminating him. Obviously,some beams were
								blocked by buildings, but no matter where he walked—even in the poorest areas—at least a
								few had unobstructed views. Indeed,before anyone built a building, their plans had to
								pass inspection that theywouldn’t interfere with the Thousand Stars. Only a very few had
								been ableto circumvent the rules, like the Guile palace.
							</p>

							<p>
								Of course, Liv thought, the same rules don’t apply to the obscenely rich.
							</p>

							<p>
								Never do. Not here.
							</p>

							<p>
								Every principality in the city was allowed to determine how it wished touse its stars
								when they weren’t needed for defense, law enforcement, orreligious duties. Some moved
								their stars in rigid schedules, making a lightclock that everyone in the district could
								easily see.
							</p>

							<p>
								Today, the first principality Liv walked through, the Embassies, washaving a market day.
								They’d fitted diffuse yellow lenses over half of theirstars, lighting an entire great
								square with cheery light. A half dozen yellowdrafters, hired specially for the occasion,
								were—without spectacles—juggling brightwater, liquid yellow luxin. Dragons exploded in
								the air, greatfountains of shimmering, evaporating yellow luxin shot skyward,
								drawinggreat crowds toward the market. The other half of the stars, fitted withlenses of
								every color, spun in great circles around the market in a dizzyingdisplay.
							</p>

							<p>
								Liv pitied the tower monkeys—the petite slaves, often children—whohad to work the ropes
								here today. Among slaves, they were well treated,even paid, their work for the
								star-keepers considered important, technicallydifficult, and even holy, but they spent
								their days in two-man teams in thenarrow spindles, one spotting and one working the
								ropes with deft hands,often working from the first shimmer of dawn until the dark of
								nightwithout reprieve except for switching with their spotter. When the Prism ora
								superviolet traveled and needed use of the stars, they could do so directly,magically.
								But every mundane purpose required the services of themonkeys.
							</p>

							<p>
								Idly, Liv considered reaching into a superviolet control line embedded inthe street and
								taking control of a star, just to wreak some havoc on the richpeople’s party. That was
								the beauty of being a superviolet. No one could tellyou were drafting who couldn’t also
								see superviolet.
							</p>

							<p>
								Still, it wasn’t like she would be the first student to do such a thing.
							</p>

							<p>
								Punishments for such pranks were swift and severe.
							</p>

							<p>
								Liv’s stomach was doing backflips, though. Despite the hubbub of themorning crowd and
								shouts of merchants and the singing of minstrels andthe crackling of the brightwater
								fireworks, nothing could distract her fromher upcoming meeting.
							</p>

							<p>
								The Crossroads was a kopi house, restaurant, tavern, the highest-pricedinn on the
								Jaspers, and downstairs, allegedly, a similarly priced brothel. Itwas centrally located
								in the Embassies District for all the ambassadors,spies, merchants trying to deal with
								various governments, and draftershaving just crossed the Lily’s Stem, because the
								Crossroads was housed in aformer embassy building. As a matter of fact, it was in the
								old Tyreanembassy. Liv wondered if her handler had done that on purpose, or if she’djust
								chosen it because she knew it was far too expensive for Liv to afford.
							</p>

							<p>
								Liv hiked up the grand staircase to the second floor where the kopihouse was. A
								beautiful greeter met her with a dazzling bright smile. TheCrossroads had the best staff
								in the city: every last man, woman, and tableslave attractive, immaculately dressed, and
								unfailingly professional. Liv hadalways suspected that the slaves here earned more than
								she did. Not thatthat would be hard. Actually, it was Liv’s first time inside.“How may
								we serve you today?” the greeter asked. “We have somelovely tables by the south window.”
								She politely didn’t stare at Liv’s roughclothing.“A private table, if possible. I’ll be
								meeting a… friend from the Ruthgariembassy, Aglaia Crassos.”“Of course, I’ll be sure to
								send her over.” The staff here knew everyonewho was anyone, by name. “Will you be
								needing muting for your table?”
							</p>

							<p>
								Muting? Oh. Liv tightened her eyes to see into the superviolet. Ofcourse. She’d
								forgotten; she’d heard about this too. A third of the tableshere were surrounded by
								superviolet bubbles. The bubbles had holes, ofcourse, or the patrons inside would
								suffocate, so the sound couldn’t becompletely cut off, but it would certainly help make
								sure it was a hundredtimes harder to eavesdrop. Some of the bubbles even had small
								spinningsuperviolet fans to blow fresh air into them. Which, Liv realized, waseminently
								practical. Those patrons who had opted to have the bubble butnot the fan looked
								uncomfortably warm.
							</p>

							<p>
								Liv was going to go way out on a limb and guess that the fan wasavailable for a small
								additional cost.
							</p>

							<p>
								Now that she was looking, she realized the greeter was herself asuperviolet drafter, her
								pupils bearing the halo barely a third of the waythrough her irises. No wonder Liv
								hadn’t noticed right away. When asuperviolet drafter got much further along, the color
								in their eyes began tobleed over into the visible range, lending a slight violet tinge
								that wasdifficult to see in brown eyes and made blue eyes astonishingly beautiful—not
								that Liv was ever going to get that, with her bland browns.“Actually…” Liv said. She
								turned her cloak so the woman could see theback. It was common for superviolets to weave
								some extra pattern into theirclothing so that other superviolets could identify them.
							</p>

							<p>
								The greeter’s pupils tightened to pinpricks in a heartbeat as she glancedat Liv’s cloak.
								“Very finely done. Superviolets are welcome to draft theirown muting, just let us know
								you’re going to be using muting when youvisit so our servers don’t make any mistakes.”
							</p>

							<p>
								The woman took Liv to a table by the windows on the south side whereshe could get
								sunlight through open windows. There was plenty of sunlighthere in the clerestory—the
								arches and flying buttresses supported all theweight of the roof easily, so the second
								story had windows from floor toceiling—but one of the downsides of being a superviolet
								was that thickwindows like those used here interfered with light collection. Any
								skilleddrafter could still use magic, but it took longer and gave some
								draftersheadaches.
							</p>

							<p>
								Liv sat and watched how the staff worked, weaving effortlessly betweentables, giving a
								wider berth to those surrounded by superviolet shells. Aslender young serving man with
								short kinky hair and a gorgeous smile cameto her table, pausing just outside where her
								bubble would have been if shehad already drafted one. He was probably only a few years
								older than her,and devastatingly beautiful, his jacket expertly tailored to a leanly
								muscledbody.
							</p>

							<p>
								Somehow, she managed to give him her order. Just a kopi. Which woulddoubtless cost a
								full danar. When he brought it back, steaming hot and darkas hellstone, and gave her a
								long smile, Liv decided the kopi was definitelyworth a danar. Maybe more.
							</p>

							<p>
								Her good mood died at the sight of Aglaia Crassos climbing the stairswith her
								butt-puckered gait. The twenty-something-year-old Ruthgari was,as best Liv could tell,
								the youngest daughter of some important family. Shehad the prized, vanishingly rare
								Ruthgari blonde hair, but other than that,she was no beauty. She had the blue eyes that
								were wasted on non-drafters,a long, horsey face, and a huge nose. Stationed at the
								Ruthgari embassy toget some political experience before she married some fiancé she
								hadn’tmet back in the city of Rath, she had always acted like she was too good tohandle
								Liv. She’d even told Liv that being assigned Liv’s case had been herpunishment for some
								indiscretion with the Atashian ambassador’s son.Mostly, she handled bichromes and
								polychromes and real spies.
							</p>

							<p>
								Catching sight of Liv, Aglaia came right over, giving a little wave to afew patrons and
								a wink to one.“Aliviana,” Aglaia said, coming to stand before her table, “you’relooking
								so… active this morning.” The pause said it all. The searchingexpression, as if she was
								really trying to find something good to say. Fromsome women, it might have been an
								accident.
							</p>

							<p>
								You want to play it like that? Fine. “Such a pleasure to see you, Aglaia.
							</p>

							<p>
								You wear petty malice so well,” Liv said. Oops.
							</p>

							<p>
								Aglaia’s eyes widened momentarily, and then she faked a laugh.“Always were a sharp
								instrument to handle, weren’t you, Liv? I love thatabout you.” She sat across from Liv.
								“Or is it just that you’re too stupid tounderstand your situation?”
							</p>

							<p>
								My father told me not to come here. Sharks and sea demons, he said. Ishould have
								listened. I’m antagonizing the woman who holds my future.“I…” Liv licked dry lips, as if
								a little lubrication would help her forcesubmissive words out. “I’m sorry. How may I be
								of assistance, Mistress?”
							</p>

							<p>
								Aglaia’s eyes lit up. “Say that again.”Liv hesitated, clenched her jaw. Forced herself
								to relax. “How may I beof assistance, Mistress?”“Draft us a bubble.”Liv drafted the
								muting bubble, complete with a fan.“Such a proud girl you are, Liv Danavis. The next
								time I have a party,
							</p>

							<p>
								I’ll have to remember to have you come serve the food. Or perhaps cleanthe chamber
								pots.”“Oh, I love cleaning chamber pots. And I love telling all my friends whohaven’t
								yet signed contracts how well the Ruthgari treat their drafters,” Livsaid.
							</p>

							<p>
								Aglaia laughed. She really did have an unpleasant laugh. “Well played,
							</p>

							<p>
								Liv. That was an empty threat, and I deserved to be called on it. You’refrom Rekton,
								aren’t you?”
							</p>

							<p>
								Liv was instantly on her guard. Aglaia had let an insult pass? Liv wouldhave expected
								that after being called on an empty threat, Aglaia would layout a real one—and she had
								quite a few possibilities at her disposal. Thatshe didn’t should have made Liv feel
								better. It didn’t.“Yes,” Liv admitted. There was no reason to lie. Nothing came from
							</p>

							<p>
								Rekton. Besides, Aglaia would have a record of where Liv was from. It wason her
								contract. “It’s a small town. Inconsequential.”“Who is Lina?”What? “She’s a serving
								woman. Katalina Delauria. Takes odd jobs.” Anaddict, a disgrace, and a nightmare of a
								mother. But Aglaia didn’t need toknow that, and Liv wasn’t going to say anything bad
								about the folks backhome.“Any family?”“None,” Liv lied. “She settled in Rekton after the
								war, like my fatherdid.”“So she’s not Tyrean?”“You mean originally? I don’t know. Some
								Parian or Ilytian blood,maybe,” Liv said. “Why?”“What’s she look like?”Too skinny, with
								bloodshot eyes and bad teeth from smoking haze. “Tall,short kinky hair, mahogany skin,
								stunning hazel eyes.” Now that Livthought about it, Lina had probably been a real beauty
								once.“And Kip? Who’s he?”Oh, hell, caught. “Uh, her son.”“Oh, she does have family,
								then.”“I thought you meant does she have any people around Rekton.”“Right,” Aglaia said.
								“How old is Kip?”“Fifteen now, I suppose.” Kip was nice, though it had been obvious
								thelast time Liv was home that he was terribly infatuated with her.“What’s he look
								like?”“Why do you want to know all this?” Liv asked.“Answer the question.”“I haven’t
								seen him for three years. He probably looks totally differentnow.” Liv threw up her
								hands, but Aglaia didn’t relent. “A bit chubby. Alittle shorter than me, the last time I
								saw him—”“For Orholam’s sake, girl, his eyes, his skin, his hair!”“Well I don’t know
								what you’re looking for!”“Now you do,” Aglaia said.“Blue eyes, medium skin, not as dark
								as his mother’s. Kinky hair.”“Half-breed?”“I guess so.” Though Liv couldn’t have said
								what Kip’s halves wouldbe. Parian and Atashian? Ilytian and Blood Forester? Something
								else?Probably not simple halves, whatever he was. “Half-breed” was a meandescription,
								though, and completely unfair. The finest families and all thenobles in the Seven
								Satrapies intermarried far more often than commoners,and they were never called
								half-breeds.“Blue eyes, though. That’s interesting. Not many people in your townwith
								blue eyes, are there?”“My father has blue eyes. There’s a few among people who settled
								thereafter the war, but no, we’re like the rest of Tyrea.”“Is he a drafter?”“Of course
								he is. My father’s one of the most famous red—”“Not your father, idiot girl. Kip.”“Kip?
								No! Well, not the last time I saw him. He was twelve or thirteenthen.”
							</p>

							<p>
								Aglaia sat back. “I should let you grope in the dark after your attitudetoday, but then
								you’d be even more likely to muss everything than youalready are. I have an assignment
								for you, Liv Danavis. It turns out that mypunishment of having to deal with you was
								Orholam’s gift in disguise. Weintercepted a letter this woman Lina wrote to the
								Prism.”“She what?”“She claimed Kip was his bastard.”Liv laughed, it was so ridiculous.
								Aglaia’s face said she wasn’t kidding.“What?!” Liv asked.“She said she was dying, and
								she wanted Gavin to meet his son Kip. Wedon’t know if it’s their first communication or
								not. But she didn’t ask foranything, or threaten him. Kip’s the right age, and Gavin had
								blue eyesbefore becoming the Prism. The rest is inconclusive, but the note waswritten as
								if it were true. As if Gavin knows her.” Aglaia smiled. “Liv, I’mgoing to give you an
								opportunity at a better life, and I hope I don’t need totell you that I can already make
								you have a much worse life, if I so choose.
							</p>

							<p>
								You tested as a superviolet and a marginal yellow. For obvious reasons,your sponsor
								chose not to train you as a bichrome.”
							</p>

							<p>
								Yes, Liv knew it well. A bichrome was expected to be kept in a certainstyle, or it
								reflected badly on the sponsor and the sponsoring country. Andyellow was so hard to
								draft well that few who were trained in yellow passedthe final examination. So
								supporting a yellow bichrome was a hugeinvestment, with little possibility of a return.
								Liv’s sponsor had pretendedshe wasn’t a bichrome to save his money. It wasn’t fair, but
								there was noone to speak up for Tyreans.“Here’s your assignment, girl. I’ve maneuvered
								things so that your classwill be up next for the Prism’s personal instruction. Get close
								to him—”“You want me to spy on the Prism?” Liv asked. The very notion wasnearly…
								blasphemous.“Of course we do. He may solicit you for information about his son andthis
								woman Lina. Use that opportunity. Become indispensable to him.Become his lover. Whatever
								you need to—”“What? He’s twice my age!”“And that would be horrible—if you were forty
								years old. You’re not.
							</p>

							<p>
								It’s not like we’re talking about someone old and decrepit. Tell me the truth,you’ve
								already dreamed about him tearing off your clothes, haven’t you?”“No, absolutely not!”
								Really she’d just admired him. Every girl did that.
							</p>

							<p>
								But for Liv, it had been completely abstract. Platonic.“Oh, a saint you are. Or a liar.
								I guarantee every other red-bloodedwoman in the Chromeria has dreamed about it. No
								matter. You’ll thinkabout it now.”“You want me to seduce him?!”“It is the easiest way to
								be in a man’s room while he’s sleeping. Then ifhe wakes while you’re rifling through his
								letters, you can pretend to bejealous and say you’re looking for letters from some other
								lover. Truth is,we don’t care how you get close to him, but let’s be honest: what do
								youhave to offer the Prism? Witty conversation? Insight? Not so much. On theother hand,
								you’re pretty for a Tyrean. You’re young, not very bright,uncultured, not powerful, not
								a scholar or a poet or a singer. If you can getclose to him some other way, great. I’m
								just betting the odds.”
							</p>

							<p>
								It was the most eviscerating way to be told you were pretty that Liv hadever heard.
								“Forget it. I’m not going to be your whore.”“Your piety’s touching, but it’s not whoring
								if you want to do it, is it?
							</p>

							<p>
								You’ve seen him. He’s gorgeous. So you get a few extra benefits. You canenjoy him, you
								can bask in every woman’s jealousy, you get everything thatwe offer—”“I don’t want
								anything more from you.”“You should have thought of that before you signed your
								contract. Butthat’s in the past. Liv, if you can get even one private meeting with
								GavinGuile, we will set you up as a bichrome. Get close to him, and we’ll makeyour
								rewards even richer than that. But spit in my face, and everything inyour life can turn
								to hellstone. I have full power over your contract, and Iwill use it.”
							</p>

							<p>
								The offer of setting up Liv as a bichrome seemed awfully generous justfor getting one
								meeting with the Prism, but she saw the logic behind it. APrism could do what he wanted,
								but sleeping with a Tyrean monochromewould seem questionable, tasteless. Slumming. A
								bichrome, on the otherhand, at least had some standing. The truth was, the offer was
								still probablygenerous, and might make Gavin more suspicious of them, but the
								prize—having a spy next to the Prism himself—was worth so much that theRuthgari were
								willing to risk it. They needed Liv to say yes.“Besides,” Aglaia said. “If you’re
								smarter than I think you are, you canfind out for yourself who gave the orders to burn
								Garriston. You could findout who’s responsible for your mother’s death.”
							</p>

							<p>
								Chapter 31
							</p>

							<p>
								Gavin had hunted down hundreds of color wights, and this one didn’t feelright.
							</p>

							<p>
								The madness struck every color wight differently, but blue wightsalways reveled in
								order. They loved the hardness of blue luxin. Mosteventually tried to remake themselves
								with it. Every one of them believedthey could avoid madness if only they were careful
								enough, smart enough,and thought through every step. But what was a blue wight doing
								crossingthe reddest desert in the Seven Satrapies?
							</p>

							<p>
								Rondar Wit had been posted in one of the smaller coastal cities of
							</p>

							<p>
								Ruthgar. Married, four children, and a good relationship with his lordpatron, who’d
								waited two weeks to report Rondar’s disappearance—no oneliked to believe that their
								friend might go mad.
							</p>

							<p>
								Gavin trudged through the desert. He’d stopped briefly at one of hiscontacts on the
								coast, got dressed entirely in red, and armed, and stillthought he should reach the
								wight before dark. Still, he was exhausted.Skimming was fast, but his arms and shoulders
								and stomach and legs ached.His will felt sapped. He didn’t get lightsick when he drafted
								too much—buthe did get tired and shaky.
							</p>

							<p>
								Coming near the top of a dune, he stopped so as not to skyline himselfand drafted a pair
								of long lenses. Tracking blues was usually easy becauseno matter how smart they were,
								most couldn’t bear to be illogical. If youfigured out where they were going, you could
								guess they would take themost efficient route there. Gavin had no idea where this one
								was going, buthe was following the coast. Unless his objective was nearby, Gavin
								wasgoing to assume that the giist would continue heading down the coastline,staying far
								enough from the coast to avoid farms and towns. Of course, thiswight had made a mistake,
								coming in too close from the desert for the sakeof speed and access to water, and had
								been seen by a boy herding the rangydesert cattle the nomads kept. The boy had told his
								father, and his father hadtold everyone, including Gavin’s contact.
							</p>

							<p>
								For a few days, the wight would try to put as much distance betweenhimself and the
								herders as possible.
							</p>

							<p>
								So Gavin made guesses, drafting blue to help himself think like one ofthem. Assuming the
								blue wight didn’t have a horse that the boy hadn’t seen—and horses usually hated color
								wights—a man pushing hard through thisdesert could only move so fast. Gavin had been
								through here before, andthough he didn’t know it intimately, there were a number of
								points where aman had to decide if he wanted to follow the coastal road or take a
								trader’sroute through the Cracked Lands. And there were places where the CrackedLands
								were so broken and treacherous that there was no discernible traders’route at all. Gavin
								wasn’t going to choose one or the other. He waited at oneof the places where the roads
								met and diverged.
							</p>

							<p>
								And waited. He untucked his shirt, pulled it askew, rebuttoned it offsetone button, and
								tucked it back in. And waited. He drafted sub-red into firecrystals to bleed off heat
								from his body, watching the tiny crystals takeshape, crinkle, and then flame out. Every
								ten minutes, he trudged back highon the great dune to poke his head over and scan the
								desert.
							</p>

							<p>
								As the sun descended, he saw the telltale gleam. Aches forgotten, he wasagain, a
								circling hawk, waiting for the marmot to step just this far from hishole. He felt the
								same spasm of black fury that he felt every time. He shouldkill it, kill it instantly,
								and not listen to its lies, its justifications, its haughtymadness.
							</p>

							<p>
								No, this time, he needed to listen. First.This giist’s skin was layered with blue luxin.
								It wasn’t just armor: it wasa carapace. Chromaturgy changed all men, but blue wights
								were seduced bythe perfections of magic. They sought to trade flesh for luxin. This one
								hadprogressed further than most. Talented, then, not to mention meticulous andlikely
								brilliant. It still wore blue pants and shirt, though both were dirty
								and,uncharacteristically for a blue’s personality, torn. So it thought it was almostdone
								with the need for clothing, but either the dangers of exposure in thedesert or the
								possibility of needing just a bit more blue to draft from hadconvinced the creature to
								keep its clothing for a little longer. Its face,though, was the true wonder—or horror,
								depending on how you looked atit.
							</p>

							<p>
								It had insinuated blue luxin beneath its very skin. Gavin had seen itbefore. The process
								had to be done slowly and carefully enough to notcause infections or rejection, but once
								begun, it had to be finished quickly.The skin lost feeling and began dying as soon as it
								was cut off from thebody, so the wight began sloughing off rotting skin. This one’s
								forehead hadsplit open, revealing robin’s egg blue beneath peeling, necrotic skin. It
								haddrafted blue covers for its eyes arcing from brow to cheekbones in a soliddome so it
								would effectively always be wearing blue spectacles, but theresult made it look like a
								bug with bulging blue eyes. It was, Gavin hadalways thought, one of the worst parts of
								giists trying to remake themselves.If all your skin died, your eyelids died. Even if you
								could draft a thin bluemembrane every time you needed to clear your eyes—and it had to
								be heldblue luxin, because rubbing blue glass against your eyeballs was never agood
								idea—even if you deal with that, you could never close your eyes tosleep. Even wights
								needed sleep.
							</p>

							<p>
								An hour later, as the sun was almost touching the horizon, burning thedesert beautiful,
								Gavin put on his borrowed red spectacles, gathered the redcloak around himself, cracked
								open a white mag torch, and stepped out infront of the giist.
							</p>

							<p>
								The blue wight convulsed. Blues hated surprises, hated not havingforeseen something,
								hated having their plans disrupted. But they were alsohard to read, the blue perfection
								of a luxin face preventing facial expressionof emotions even as the magic in their veins
								slowly obliterated theircapacity to feel them.
							</p>

							<p>
								But the surprise lasted only a moment. The giist sprinted straight for
							</p>

							<p>
								Gavin, its skin afire with blue, its eyes literally aglow, buggy, lit fromwithin with
								refracting blue light. Gavin tossed the mag torch down in thesand in front of himself
								and threw open his red cloak, taking a wide stanceon the side of the dune as the giist
								charged.
							</p>

							<p>
								Gavin’s hand swept up past the weapons harness, little fingers of redluxin plucking all
								the tiny daggers from their sheaths. As he took one greatstep forward with his left
								foot, he drafted a dozen thin barrels along his arm.Then his right arm whipped forward
								with all the energy coiled in his bodyadded to the force of his will. The dozen tiny
								daggers became steel missilesas he flung them. They flew at incredible speed, one after
								the other.
							</p>

							<p>
								A blue shield sprang from the wight’s left arm and blossomed huge, tocatch the splashing
								fire it expected from a red drafter with a mag torch.Instead, the steel daggers hit with
								a sound like hail on a tin roof. The shieldpitted, cracked, cracked wide, and gaped
								open. The last three daggers sailedcleanly through. The first struck its cheek and
								deflected off its carapace.The next cut only the air next to its neck, and the last
								buried itself in thewight’s shoulder.
							</p>

							<p>
								The giist had already begun its counterstroke, though. It flung its rightfist forward
								and five enormous spikes formed in the air around its hand andstabbed for Gavin’s
								stomach in a line so that even if he moved left or right,he’d still be skewered.
							</p>

							<p>
								Gavin cheated, of course. He drafted a solid platform beneath the sandto give himself a
								solid surface to jump off of and dove down the dune,flipping and landing in a great
								slide down the dune’s face.
							</p>

							<p>
								The giist whipped around, dropping its luxin spears and drafting a bluegreat sword in
								their place. It saw that Gavin had lost his spectacles in hisdive, and it twitched a
								smile. Its cheek had been sliced by Gavin’s dagger,and a flap of skin peeled open,
								drooping toward earth, showing acrosshatched network of blood vessels and blue luxin,
								though the luxin wascracked and broken at the point of impact, capillaries oozing blood.
								Thedagger in its left shoulder seemed to be hampering its motion, but it wasnothing
								lethal.“You reds,” the giist said, its voice gravelly, as if it hadn’t spoken insome
								time. “So impulsive. You thought you could take me, alone, justbecause it’s sunset in a
								desert?”
							</p>

							<p>
								Gavin glanced at his spectacles lying on the sand above him. The giistsaw it and swung
								its great sword. The blade elongated in midair, closing thefull five paces, and smashed
								the red spectacles to bits, then shortened again.“You should leave murdering the
								Unchained to your Prism,” the giistsaid.
							</p>

							<p>
								The Unchained?Gavin said, “They told us the Prism was too important for you. Theytold us
								we should be able to handle one blue wight in the middle of a desert.They said Rondar
								Wit wasn’t that gifted.”
							</p>

							<p>
								The giist laughed. “Was that supposed to make me angry? I’m not
							</p>

							<p>
								Rondar any longer. The Prism’s empire crumbles over your head, slave.Join us. See what
								it is to be free. You have, what, perhaps five years left?
							</p>

							<p>
								Not long, not even for a drafter in their world. Why die for their false god?Why die for
								their lies? Why die, ever?”
							</p>

							<p>
								The giist was trying to recruit him? This was different. Gavin kept hiseyes squinted.
								The less the giist saw his eyes, the less likely it was to noticehow odd they were.
								“False god?” Gavin asked. Immortality?
							</p>

							<p>
								Slimy held blue luxin swiped along the insides of its bug eyes, from theinner corner to
								the outer. Blinking. “Surely you don’t believe in Orholam?Are you all corrupt, or just
								stupid? If Orholam himself chooses the Prism asthe Chromeria has preached since
								Lucidonius, how could there be twoPrisms in one generation? Or are you one of the mental
								cowards who shrugsand calls it a mystery, who says Orholam’s ways are ineffable?”
							</p>

							<p>
								It was one thing for a color wight to run: not even blues were immune tocowardice. But
								an attack on Orholam himself was a heresy that cut to theroot of the world. If you
								called Orholam a fraud, and said everyone inpower must know it, the Chromeria became the
								purveyor of lies, anoppressor who stole from you, not a friend who needed your help to
								sustaintheir worthy efforts. “I haven’t believed in Orholam for years,” Gavin
								said,honestly. “But why trade one superstition for another?”
							</p>

							<p>
								The giist glanced at Gavin’s shirt, noticing the buttons weren’t doneproperly. Good. Any
								time it spent looking at his buttons was time it didn’tspend looking at his eyes. “You
								stop believing lies so you can believe thetruth, not so you can believe nothing at all.
								King Garadul has…” He trailedoff, looking at Gavin suspiciously. Putting something
								together.“King Garadul, is he who leads the Unchained?” Gavin asked.“Who are you?” it
								demanded. “You aren’t nervous. And you should be.”
							</p>

							<p>
								It tore the dagger out of its shoulder, sealed the wound, and tossed thedagger aside. It
								drew a long, ball-handled matchlock pistol from the raggedpouch, began loading in a
								precise manner with the odd, quick, butabsentminded mode blue wights sometimes had. It
								used blue luxin like anextension of its hands. Blue luxin ramrod, blue luxin fingers to
								hold theslow match, blue luxin to draw out the powder horn and a lead ball. Itgrabbed
								the still-burning mag torch from the sand and held it up to light theslow match.
								“Foolish, rash red drafter,” the giist said, glancing down atGavin’s misbuttoned shirt.
								“You should always spend the extra to buy amag torch in your own color.”“I did,” Gavin
								said.
							</p>

							<p>
								The giist’s eyes snapped from the white torch to Gavin’s eyes. Eventhrough the buggy eye
								cover and the frozen luxin face, Gavin readrealization in every line of the giist’s
								body.
							</p>

							<p>
								Before it could move, Gavin leapt forward with an insane scream.Taken off guard, the
								giist lost concentration on the luxin hand holdingthe mag torch, and that hand
								disintegrated, dropping the flaming brand. Thegiist didn’t forget its great sword or the
								pistol, though. It lifted the blade toimpale Gavin, raised the pistol.
							</p>

							<p>
								Drafting parrying sticks of blue luxin in each hand, Gavin slapped theblade aside. He
								flung the giist’s hands wide. Letting the parrying sticksdisintegrate, he drafted. A
								narrow blue blade sprang from his palm. Hestepped close, inside the blue wight’s arms
								even as the pistol’s hammerclicked and the match slapped down. He slammed blade and palm
								into thegiist’s chest, its carapace yielding with a popping sound. Gavin shed
								theremaining blue luxin with a flick of his arms and pulled in the hottest sub-reds he
								could handle into each hand. Flames curled around his fists as heclenched them.
							</p>

							<p>
								The pistol roared and went spinning harmlessly out of the giist’s hand.It staggered
								back, but Gavin stepped in close once again. He threw twoquick jabs, left hand to the
								giist’s right eye, right hand to its left eye. Theblue bug-eye lenses cracked, melted,
								releasing a quick burst of resin andchalk smells. It all happened so fast the blue wight
								couldn’t resist. Blueswere slow to react when they found their presuppositions were
								wrong.
							</p>

							<p>
								Broken, the giist sank, sat, tried to catch itself, and fell on the sand.
							</p>

							<p>
								Despite its solid blue lidless eyes, despite the burned skin and thecrosshatched blue
								luxin through the cut on its cheek, to Gavin it lookedabruptly human once more.
							</p>

							<p>
								The startled look in those broken-haloed eyes.The red red blood spilling down its
								chest.And suddenly, the figure looked more like a man than like the monsterthat Gavin
								had found standing over Sevastian’s bed all those years ago, thewindow broken open
								behind him, light gleaming off blue skin and redblood.
							</p>

							<p>
								Gavin took a deep, unsteady breath. He’d stopped it this time. Noinnocents had died. And
								there was one decency left to extend, not becauseRondar Wit deserved it, but in spite of
								the fact that he didn’t.“You gave the full measure, Rondar Wit. Your service will not
								beforgotten, but your failures are blotted out, forgotten, erased. I give youabsolution.
								I give you freedom. I—”“Dazen!” the giist shouted, hands clutching its wound,
								writhing.Gavin was so startled he lost his place in the funerary rite.“Dazen leads us,
								and the Color Prince is his strong right hand.” The giistlaughed, blood flecking his
								segmented blue lips.“Dazen’s dead,” Gavin said, his gut twisting.“Light cannot be
								chained, Prism. Not even by you. You’re the heretic,not…” And then the darkness of death
								closed over the giist at last.

								Chapter 32
							</p>

							<p>
								Kip barely had time to get scrubbed down with towels, dressed in somesoldier’s pants and
								a dry shirt and heavy boots—surprisingly enough, it allfit; apparently they were used to
								big soldiers out here—and plopped in frontof a fire before Ironfist showed up. His
								tightly curled hair was damp, butotherwise there was nothing to give away that he had
								just been in the oceantoo. He wore a regulation gray uniform like Kip’s, though with a
								goldseven-pointed star and two bars on his lapel, where Kip’s uniform wasblank.“Up,”
								Ironfist said.Kip stood, rubbing his arms in what seemed a vain effort to get warm.
								“Ithought you were a commander of the Blackguard. Why are you wearing acaptain’s
								uniform?”
							</p>

							<p>
								Ironfist’s eyebrow barely twitched. “So you know Chromerian ranks?”“Master Danavis
								taught me all the military ranks of all Seven Satrapies.
							</p>

							<p>
								He thought—”“That’s nice. You have all your belongings?” Ironfist said.Kip scowled, at
								being interrupted and dismissed and at the thought ofbelongings. “I don’t have any
								stuff. I didn’t have that much to start with,and—”“So the answer is yes,” Ironfist
								said.So that was how it was going to be. “Yes,” Kip said. “Sir.” He was onlya little
								sardonic with the sir, but Ironfist looked at him sharply, no humor atall in the one
								raised eyebrow. He really was very big. Not just tall, not justreally tall. Rippling
								with muscle. Intimidating. Kip looked away. He clearedhis throat awkwardly. “I’m sorry
								you had to dive in and get me. I’m sorry Imade you lose your spectacles. I’ll pay you
								back, I promise.”
							</p>

							<p>
								Suddenly, to his complete horror, Kip felt tears welling up fromnowhere. Orholam, no!
								But the pull was as irresistible as the riptide. Hisstomach convulsed as he tried to
								choke back the sob, but it escaped anyway.He was so sick of being weak. He was the child
								who couldn’t even hold onto the rope someone put in his hands. He hadn’t been able to do
								anything.He hadn’t saved Isa when she needed him. He hadn’t saved his mother. Hehadn’t
								saved Sanson. He was powerless, stupid. When it had come down toit, he’d panicked. His
								mother was right about him.
							</p>

							<p>
								Half a dozen expressions rushed over Ironfist’s face in quick succession.
							</p>

							<p>
								He raised one hand awkwardly, lowered it, raised it again, and patted Kip’sshoulder. He
								cleared his throat. “I can requisition another pair.”
							</p>

							<p>
								Kip started laughing and crying at the same time, not because Ironfistwas funny, but
								because the big man thought Kip was crying about hisspectacles.“There you go,” Ironfist
								said. He thumped Kip’s shoulder with the sideof his fist in what Kip thought was
								supposed to be a friendly manner—except it hurt. Kip rubbed his shoulder and laugh-cried
								harder.“Let’s go,” Kip said, shrinking back lest Ironfist tap one of hisnamesakes on his
								shoulder again and leave a smoking ruin.
							</p>

							<p>
								Ironfist’s eyebrows twitched up in a momentary expression of relief.“Almost as bad as
								dealing with a woman, huh?” Kip said.Ironfist stopped cold. “How’d…” he trailed off.
								“You are a Guile, aren’tyou?”“What do you mean?” Kip asked.“Let’s go,” Ironfist said in
								a tone that brooked no argument. Kip didn’thesitate. He didn’t know what precisely
								Ironfist would do to him if hedidn’t obey, but knowing was a logical process. Fear was
								faster.
							</p>

							<p>
								Outside, he saw that they’d rigged up another boat on the ramp. Herubbed his clammy arms
								and stared at the sea. The tide was halfway in andgetting worse, and the waves crashed
								powerfully over the rocks of CannonIsland. This boat was a small sailing dinghy. It
								didn’t look even as stable asthe dory. And it was smaller. Kip’s stomach
								turned.“Commander?” one of the men said. “You sure? I wouldn’t want to goout on this
								even with experienced sailors. Especially if you’re going thelong way.”
							</p>

							<p>
								Kip didn’t see the look that passed between the men, but he heard thesoldier say, “Yes,
								sir,” quickly afterward.
							</p>

							<p>
								Cannon Island was in the middle of the current that flowed between
							</p>

							<p>
								Little Jasper and Big Jasper. Little Jasper Bay was calm, protected by aseawall, but Kip
								and Ironfist were headed the opposite direction, to circlethree-quarters of Big Jasper
								in order to get to its bay.“Aren’t we going to the Chromeria?” Kip asked. He could see
								the topsof colored towers, only partially visible above the rocky body of CannonIsland.
								“Why can’t we go to their bay? It’s closer.”“Because we’re not going straight there,”
								Ironfist said. He gestured for
							</p>

							<p>
								Kip to get in and handed him an oar.
							</p>

							<p>
								The men pushed them off and Ironfist began rowing hard. Kip did hisbest to keep up with
								the big man, but almost immediately they beganturning toward Kip’s side. Ironfist said
								nothing; he just switched sides androwed hard a few times on Kip’s side until they were
								straight, then returnedto his own side. The commander aimed them so they quartered the
								waves.Kip’s heart was constantly in his throat. The three- and four-foot-tall
								wavesyielded to five- and six-foot-tall waves.
							</p>

							<p>
								And then Ironfist raised their little sail a third of the way. “Keep usstraight,” he
								barked, working the lines. Kip felt like a headless chicken,flopping awkwardly from one
								side of the boat to the other, keeping themheaded slowly forward, going up each wave
								with a lurch and swoopingdown the opposite side.“Down! Get down!” Ironfist shouted. Kip
								dropped just as the windshifted and the sail swung from one side of the boat to the
								other, the boomwhipping over his head. It snapped so hard against the ropes that
								Kipthought it might tear off or break.
							</p>

							<p>
								Orholam, that could have been my head.The dinghy leaned over hard, even with the sail
								only a third of the wayraised, and jumped forward. Kip had barely gotten back up to his
								knees, andthe sudden forward motion made him tumble backward, splashing into thecold
								dirty water at the bottom of the dinghy.“The rudder! Take the rudder!” Ironfist
								ordered.Kip grabbed the rudder and held it straight for a long moment, thoughthe dinghy
								was turned too far away from the wind—taking the wavesalmost side on. He blinked
								seawater out of his eyes. Throw the rudder thisway, it turns at the fulcrum there, and
								the boat turns… Got it.
							</p>

							<p>
								Part of the next wave sloshed over the gunwales as Kip threw the rudderhard toward the
								port side. A hard gust of wind made the dinghy bear downeven farther in the water, then
								they popped up hard as they escaped thekilling grip of the wave.
							</p>

							<p>
								Kip whooped as they sped forward, riding the waves, plowing throughthem at times now,
								rather than simply being at their mercy. But Ironfistdidn’t share his joy. He was
								glancing up at the sky. He raised the sails alittle more, and the dinghy picked up even
								more speed, leaning so hard tothe port side that Kip thought they were going to capsize.
							</p>

							<p>
								When they reached the west side of Big Jasper, they were able to runbefore the wind. It
								was like flying.
							</p>

							<p>
								Ironfist kept glancing south, but the dark clouds there seemed todissipate rather than
								gather, and by the time they turned into Big Jasper’swind shadow, Kip could tell from
								Ironfist’s demeanor that they were out ofdanger.“There’s a small dock that we want, head
								straight,” Ironfist told him,raising their sail all the way.
							</p>

							<p>
								So Kip aimed them past galleys and galleasses, corvettes armed with asingle gun mounted
								on a swivel, and galleons with fifteen cannons on eachside. They stayed fairly far out
								so they wouldn’t interfere with the constantstream of ships coming in and out of the
								bay, the dinghies taking crewsashore.“Is it always like this?” Kip asked.“Always,”
								Ironfist said. “Bay’s too small, so to accommodate thenumber of boats needed to keep
								trade flowing smoothly there’s an elaboratesystem to determine who gets in first. It
								works…” He glanced up at acaptain swearing loudly at the harborman standing on his deck
								with anabacus. The harborman looked singularly unimpressed. “For the most part.”
							</p>

							<p>
								Between having to veer sharply now and again to avoid other boatsaccording to some
								ships’ etiquette that he didn’t understand, Kip didn’t getto catch more than a few
								glimpses of the city covering Big Jasper. And fromwhat he saw, it did cover Big Jasper.
								There was a wall just above shorearound the entire island—leagues of walls—but even that
								couldn’t hide thecity as it rose on two hills. Aside from a few green
								patches—gardens?parks? mansions’ grounds?—there were buildings everywhere.
								Soaringbulbous domes in every color, everywhere. And people, more people thanKip had
								ever seen.“Kip. Kip! Port! Gawk later.”Kip tore his eyes off the island and turned to
								port, narrowly avoidingramming a galleass. They sailed past under the evil eye of the
								galleass’sknotted-haired first mate. He looked like he was going to spit on them, butsaw
								their uniforms and spat on his own deck instead.
							</p>

							<p>
								They proceeded into open water until they started to round the easternside of the
								island. “Turn in here,” Ironfist said. Kip turned toward a littledock with a few small
								fishing boats moored to it. They docked and headedup to the wall. Kip tried not to gawk,
								though the wall itself was easily thebiggest man-made structure he’d ever seen.
							</p>

							<p>
								Ironfist strode to the gate. The guards outside looked confused.“Captain?” Then they
								snapped sharp salutes, eyes wide. “Commander!”
							</p>

							<p>
								A smaller door inset to the larger gate was open, and Ironfist walkedthrough, nodding to
								acknowledge the men. The city inside was toooverwhelming for Kip to comprehend even part
								of it. But the part that hithim first was the smell.
							</p>

							<p>
								Ironfist must have noticed the look on his face. “You think this is bad?
							</p>

							<p>
								You should try a city without sewers.”“No,” Kip said, looking at the hundreds of people
								in the streets, thethree- and four-story buildings everywhere, the cobbled streets with
								tracksworn a hand’s breadth down into the stones. “It’s just that there’s so much.”And
								there was. Smells of cooking pork, spices Kip didn’t know, fresh fish,rotting fish, a
								thin odor of human waste and a stronger one of horse andcattle manure, and, overwhelming
								it all, the smell of unwashed men andwomen.
							</p>

							<p>
								The people parted naturally around Ironfist, and Kip followed in hiswake, trying not to
								run into anyone as he shot glances at all the people.There were men wearing ghotras like
								Ironfist, but also bedecked in robeswith checkered patterns and loud colors. There were
								Atashian men withtheir impressive beards: beads, braids, natural sections, and more
								beads andbraids. There were Ilytian women with multilayered dresses and shoesnearly like
								stilts, making them a full hand taller. And a riot of colorseverywhere. Every color in
								the rainbow, combined in every possible way.Ironfist looked back at Kip, amused.“Those
								soldiers at the gate,” Kip said, trying to take Ironfist’s attentionoff his being a
								bumpkin. “Those weren’t your men.”“No,” Ironfist said.“But they recognized you, and you
								didn’t recognize them, and they werereally excited that they’d seen you.”
							</p>

							<p>
								Ironfist looked at Kip again, scowling. “How old are you again?”“I’m fift—”“The
								commander,” Ironfist said. As if that answered everything. Hesmirked as Kip scurried up
								beside him. “You’re the genius. Let’s hear it,”he said.
							</p>

							<p>
								Genius? I never acted like I thought I was that. But that was adistraction. This was a
								test. In fact, Ironfist had been testing Kip the wholetime, Kip saw now. Putting him on
								the rudder had been a test, to see whathe would do, how quickly he would figure it out,
								and if he would freeze up.Kip wasn’t even sure how well he’d done on that count.
							</p>

							<p>
								Ironfist was a commander. A commander, the commander. Thecommander. Oh. Oh my.“There’s
								only one company of Blackguards, isn’t there?” Kip asked.Like most of Ironfist’s
								expressions, this one was quick and quicklymuted: the full white of his eyes around dark
								irises visible for a baremoment, then a little smirk to cover. “Not bad, given the
								obvious hint, Isuppose.”“So you’re the sole commander of the most elite company in the
							</p>

							<p>
								Chromeria. That makes you like a general or something?”“Or something.”“Oh,” Kip said.
								“So that means I should probably be even moreintimidated of you than I am right now,
								huh?”
							</p>

							<p>
								Ironfist laughed. “No, I think you’ve got it just about perfect.” Hegrinned.“What were
								you doing pulling guard duty on that rock?”“It is a bit more than a rock.”Put that way,
								it did make some sense. The Blackguard had to protect the
							</p>

							<p>
								Chromeria’s most important people, and a secret escape tunnel was the kindof thing you
								had to check yourself. “Still,” Kip said.
							</p>

							<p>
								They came to a much wider road and Ironfist—Commander Ironfist—turned onto it, heading
								west, the opposite direction of almost all of thetraffic. He sighed. “It’s not a duty
								anyone wants, so it’s sometimes used aspunishment. Let’s just say I’ve given the White
								reason to be displeasedrecently.”
							</p>

							<p>
								Kip said quietly, “Or that’s a cover so you can go out and check themaintenance of the
								tunnel.”“Except that a tunnel is… a tunnel. Don’t make things more complicatedthan they
								are, little Guile.”
							</p>

							<p>
								Huh? “Oh.” Ironfist could come from the Chromeria side and make surethe tunnel worked.
								He didn’t need to sail out to the island for that. Somegenius I am. Embarrassed, Kip
								rushed to ask another question, and askedthe question he knew he shouldn’t. “So what did
								you do to make him madat you? You know, the White.”“Him?” Ironfist asked.“Her?”Ironfist
								turned in at a little house with an oxidized copper dome,unlocked the door, and pointed
								for Kip to go in. “There’s hard tack andcheese and olives in the kitchen. Latrine off to
								the left. Bed straight downthe hall. You’re not to leave until I come get you tomorrow
								at dawn.”“But we came across those huge waves instead of waiting, I—I thoughtwe were
								going straight to the Chromeria.”“I’m going straight to the Chromeria.”“While I just sit
								here all day?”“When you see what you have to do tomorrow, you’ll be glad you hadthe
								rest.” Ironfist moved to leave.“But, what—what are you going to do?”“I’m going to go get
								back in the White’s good graces.”Kip scowled as the door closed. There was a click. He
								was locked in.“That’s great,” he told the closed door. “I’ll just wait here. I’ve
								beenmeaning to catch up on my thumb-twiddling.” Grumbling, he made his wayto the olives
								and cheese. Ten minutes later, he was asleep.

								Chapter 33
							</p>

							<p>
								Karris woke beneath a lean-to constructed of tree branches and a man’scloak. It was
								either dusk or dawn. She guessed dawn from the dew on theground. She examined herself
								with a soldier’s efficiency, moving each limband digit experimentally, trying to gauge
								her own potential for movement,violent or otherwise. All her fingers and toes worked
								properly, but herentire left side was bruised. She must have not only crashed through
								thedoorframe with her upper body there, but also landed on her left side,because her
								shin ached, her knee ached, there were gravel scratches on herhip, her breast felt like
								someone had mistaken it for a sawdust-filledtraining bag and punched it for an hour, and
								her shoulder—Orholam, hershoulder. She could breathe without much pain, though, which
								she hopedmeant there weren’t any broken ribs, and she could still move her arm,although
								it almost made her black out to do so.
							</p>

							<p>
								Her right side hadn’t escaped undamaged either. She had long gravelscrapes on her right
								arm and her stomach, probably some to match on herback, and her neck was sore from
								Orholam knew what. She’d stubbed allthe toes of her right foot—didn’t remember doing
								that either—and her lefteye was swollen, not enough to block her vision, but enough to
								look realpretty. There was also a scratch on her forehead, several attractive lumps
								onher head, and—what the hell, a cut right on the tip of her nose?
							</p>

							<p>
								No, not a cut. A pimple. Unbe—A pimple? Now? Orholam hates me.Every one of her cuts and
								scratches had been smeared with some kind ofointment that smelled of berries and pine
								needles. Someone cleared histhroat. “There’s more ointment to your right. I tended the
								more… obviouscuts.”
							</p>

							<p>
								Which Karris took to mean that Corvan hadn’t stripped her naked.“Thanks,” she grumbled.
								“What happened back there?”“Aside from the obvious?” Corvan asked, his voice flat.“In
								the church, downstairs. I’ve never seen red luxin that didn’t burncleanly. If you
								drafted it wrong, it should have evaporated, not formed acrust. And what was that thing
								you were in?” Karris sat up, wincing. Herankle hurt too. Ow, when had she twisted her
								ankle? She ignored it, andtried to remember all she knew about Corvan Danavis. He’d been
								a rebel, ofcourse, but before he’d sided with Dazen, he’d been a scion of one of
								thegreat Ruthgari families. For nearly a hundred years, Ruthgar and the BloodForest had
								been bound together in peace, the closest of allies. Noblefamilies from Ruthgar had
								intermarried with the leading families of BloodForesters, holding lands on either side
								of the Great River. Other peoples hadbegun referring to the countries as one, merging
								the Verdant Plains and theBlood Forest to call the joint country Green Forest. Vician’s
								Sin had put anend to that, and by a generation before the False Prism’s War, the
								countrieswere instead known as the Blood Plains. If one good thing had come fromthe
								False Prism’s War, it was that it had given Gavin the clout to finally endthe
								interminable small-scale war constantly simmering between Ruthgarand the Blood Forest.
							</p>

							<p>
								Corvan was a product of that conflict. Born into a warrior family, withsome ungodly
								number of brothers (eight? ten?), he was, Karris thought sheremembered, the last one
								alive. Karris barely remembered him from beforethe False Prism’s War. He was just
								another Ruthgari from old blood leftsuddenly penniless with little more than the fine
								weapons he carried and thefine clothes on his back. He’d been a monochrome, too, so his
								prospects ofreclaiming wealth in some other land had been dismal. When the war
								hadstarted, he’d joined Dazen immediately, like so many other dispossessedyoung lords
								with everything to gain.
							</p>

							<p>
								Karris had been fifteen years old, and she couldn’t remember Corvanpersonally at all.
								Which, she supposed, wasn’t too surprising, given all theattention she’d been getting
								from the Guile brothers. He’d been an adviseronly for much of the war, but near the end
								of the war, Dazen had made hima general. Karris had heard Commander Ironfist credit that
								fact with Gavinwinning the war—not calling Corvan Danavis incompetent, but theopposite.
								Commander Ironfist had said that if Corvan Danavis had been ageneral for the whole war,
								Gavin’s armies wouldn’t have even made it tothe Battle of Sundered Rock. Ironfist had
								further said that if GeneralDanavis hadn’t surrendered unconditionally after Sundered
								Rock, theremight still be guerrillas fighting in half of the Seven Satrapies.
								Corvan’sgrace in defeat had convinced his men to go home.
							</p>

							<p>
								Dipping her fingers into the bowl of ointment, Karris gave Corvan alook. He appeared
								confused. She began lifting her long shirt, ointment onher fingers, and he got it. He
								cleared his throat and turned away. Karrissmeared ointment gingerly on the scrapes on
								her chest, giving herself timeto think.
							</p>

							<p>
								With all that history, Karris expected Corvan Danavis would be somegraybeard. This man
								was in his mid-forties, shaven except for a day ortwo’s stubble. His skin was lighter
								than most Tyreans, but much darker thanBlood Forester pale, though he did perhaps have
								some freckles on hischeeks. His eyes were blue—no shock there, with the ludicrous amount
								ofred he’d been able to draft. The luxin halo was only halfway through hisirises—even
								less than Karris’s, despite his being probably twelve or fifteenyears older than she
								was. There were perhaps red highlights in his dark hair,too, and his hair was wavy
								rather than kinky. And the general had beenfamous for his red mustache, which he’d kept
								trimmed except at the endsthat dangled below his chin, where he’d tied red and gold
								beads. Maybe thiswas some other Corvan Danavis, or some man who’d taken his name,hoping
								to profit from the general’s good reputation. “They were on usbefore we knew what was
								happening,” Corvan said. “I’d counseled thevillage to send a boy or two for the levies
								but even I didn’t expect this kindof retribution. King Garadul came here not to teach us
								a lesson, but to teachthe rest of Tyrea one. I’ve only run into his like once before.”
								GeneralDelmarta, the Butcher of Ru, Karris guessed.“You saw the pyramid?” Karris asked,
								turning back to him.Corvan Danavis got very still. The side of his mouth ticked up in a
								snarlfor the briefest instant. But when he turned his gaze to Karris, it was cool,in
								control. There wasn’t even a hint of fresh red luxin in his eyes, whichspoke of
								astonishing control for a drafter his age. “I gathered those I couldand pulled back to
								the church.” Was he hoping Garadul’s men wouldrespect holy ground? “It’s the least
								flammable building in town” Corvansaid, answering the unspoken question. “We fought, and
								we lost. TheDelarias and the Sworrins couldn’t get the door to the basement open, and
								Iwas too busy fighting. Maybe I shouldn’t have fought at all. I think thechromaturgy
								just drew more soldiers. They overwhelmed us. I retreateddownstairs.”“Alone?”He looked
								surprised at the question. “Everyone else was dead,” he said.Except for one young
								family, not ten paces from the stairs. Had Corvanfought at all, or had he immediately
								retreated downstairs and locked thedoor behind himself, dooming the townsfolk to fiery
								death? The soldiershad carried away their dead, and the fires had obscured most of
								theevidence of battle in the temple, so Karris couldn’t know for sure.“So this is where
								you tell me how you used the most flammable luxin toescape a fire,” Karris said.“Do you
								know why you blow on a flame when you’re starting acampfire?” Corvan asked. He didn’t
								wait for Karris to answer. “Becausefire needs to breathe. I’m a monochrome, Lady White
								Oak. We have to bemore creative than near-polychromes like you.”“Just tell me what you
								did,” Karris said. How did he know she wasnearly a poly? She was still trying to decide
								if it was even possible that thiscould be General Danavis. In this backwater? And from a
								Blood Foresterfamily? The eyes and freckles spoke of Blood Forester heritage, but
								withthat skin? Of course, he had grown up in a noble family, and a familybreeding its
								sons for war. The perfect combination for a warrior drafter wasblack skin with blue
								eyes. Even caramel skin was far better than pale BloodForester skin to give a warrior an
								extra fraction of a second before theiropponents knew what color they were drafting. So
								it was possible. Noblefamilies had certainly married off their daughters and sons for
								lesserreasons. Fearing that your children wouldn’t look like natives of their ownland
								might move far down the list of concerns when pure survival was atstake.“When I went
								downstairs,” Corvan continued, “I knew they’d comeafter me, so I covered every surface
								in the room with red luxin. I sealed theroom completely and coated myself in the luxin
								as well. When the soldierscame in, I closed the door behind them and set it all afire.
								The conflagrationdevoured all the air in the room, and both the fire and the soldiers
								died.” Sothat was why the red luxin had had a crust rather than burning away cleanly.No
								air.“And the tubes?” Karris had crashed through some tubes when she’dfallen.“They led
								outside. So I could breathe.”“So why didn’t you leave after you killed them?”He stared
								hard at her. “Because if I didn’t wait until every last emberburned itself out, I’d be
								inviting the entire room to explode. As you mighthave noticed when you brought burning
								embers with you and made theentire room explode.”
							</p>

							<p>
								Oh.“Why is King Garadul gathering an army?” Karris said. “Why now?”“To assert himself,
								I’d imagine. New king, wants to show he’s tough.
							</p>

							<p>
								Does it have to be more complicated? Rask Garadul was always a crazylittle bastard.”“If
								you really are Corvan Danavis, you just lied to me,” Karris said. Ageneral of Corvan’s
								standing would have been delving into the possiblestrategies Rask might be pursuing. A
								general with Corvan’s record ofsuccess would have come up with a dozen already.
							</p>

							<p>
								Corvan paused, and if anything, Karris thought he looked pleased. “Solittle Karris White
								Oak is all grown up,” Corvan said. “Joined theBlackguard, and now a Chromeria spy.”“What
								are you talking about?” Karris said. She felt like she’d been hit inthe stomach.“The
								only question is, who wants to kill you, Karris? Not only are youmore conspicuous in
								Tyrea than even I am, what with that fine hair and fairskin, but you of all people? They
								sent you? Here?”“Why shouldn’t I be here? I came to research the southern desert
								reds—”“Seriously, Karris. Don’t demean us both. At the very least, I’m anenemy of your
								enemy. You’re here for information. I’ll give it, but not ifyou lie to me. If you go
								unprepared against these people, you’ll die.”
							</p>

							<p>
								He could have killed her in the church, Karris realized. Or he could haveleft her and
								let the fire do it. Corvan did have a sterling reputation, evenamong his enemies, and
								she needed to know what he knew. Shesurrendered, lifting her open hands. She winced. Ow,
								her left arm waskilling her. “Why can’t I be here?” she asked.“Do you have any idea what
								happened to all the men and women whofought for Dazen?” Corvan asked.“They went
								home.”“It’s always harder for the losers to go home. Dazen’s armies were amotley bunch.
								A lot of bad men, and some good ones who’d beenwronged.”“Like you,” Karris interjected
								sarcastically.“This isn’t about me. Point is, a lot of us couldn’t go home. Some wentto
								Green Haven; the Aborneans accepted a few small communities, and theIlytians claimed to
								be willing to take anyone, but the only thing anyone gotfrom them was a clipped ear.”
							</p>

							<p>
								Karris shuddered. It was how the Ilytians marked slaves. They heatedshears red-hot and
								cut the slave’s left ear nearly in half. The scar tissue keptthe ear from ever fusing
								back together and made it easy to identify who wasa slave.“Some of us were more
								fortunate,” Corvan said. “Our armies raged backand forth across this land for a few
								months, and the people here had noreason to love either side. We wiped out whole
								villages. Those that survivedhad nothing but young children, old men, and a few women.
								Most of thetowns reviled the soldiers, and where former soldiers tried to stay by
								force,Rask’s father, Satrap Perses Garadul, wiped them out. But a few townsrealized that
								if they were ever going to rebuild, they needed men. Thealcaldesa of Rekton was one of
								those. She chose two hundred soldiers andlet us stay, and she chose well. A few nearby
								towns did the same. Othermen, of course, became bandits, and even Perses Garadul
								couldn’t hunt allof those down.”“How did you get to stay?” Karris asked. “As a general,
								you were moreresponsible for what happened to this country than most.”“My wife was
								Tyrean. We’d married a few years before the war. Shewas in Garriston when… when it
								burned. One of her retainers survived andsaved our daughter and brought her to me. So I
								had a year-old little girl, andthe alcaldesa took pity on me. The point is, people
								around here rememberthe war a little differently than Gavin’s people do.”
							</p>

							<p>
								Not terribly surprising, considering they got the ass-end of the deal.“They remember it
								as a fight over a woman,” Corvan said blandly.“That’s—that’s ridiculous!” Karris
								spluttered. Orholam have mercy.“You’re a great favorite of artists here. Not that we
								have many talentedones, but the fair-skinned, exotic beauty with fiery hair still
								inspires artistsgood and bad to raptures. Even if most men wouldn’t dare believe you
								werethe same woman—you’re usually portrayed in a wedding dress, sometimestorn—Rask
								doubtless owns paintings by talented artists who’d actually seenyou.”“It wasn’t like
								that,” Karris said.“But it makes a good story.”“A good story?”“Good tragic. Good
								interesting. Not good happy.” Corvan cleared histhroat. “I can’t believe you don’t know
								this.”“There are almost no Tyreans on the Jaspers now. And no one speaks tome of those
								days.”
							</p>

							<p>
								Corvan looked on the edge of saying something, but he held his tongue.
							</p>

							<p>
								Finally, he said, “So the question is, who would send you to our new KingGaradul,
								knowing that he would surely recognize you, and what did theyhope to achieve by
								delivering you into his hands?”
							</p>

							<p>
								The White. The White betrayed me? Why?
							</p>

							<p>
								Chapter 34
							</p>

							<p>
								It had been a long morning already. Gavin had woken painfully early toreach the coast by
								the dawn, and then had skimmed as soon as he’d beenable to draft the sun’s first rays.
								Then he’d sculled to Cannon Island andmade an unpleasant, claustrophobic trip through
								the escape tunnel, leavinghim dirty, sweaty, sore, and deprived of sleep. But there was
								no other optionthan to push; not after what the color wight had told him.
							</p>

							<p>
								The tunnel met the Chromeria at a disused storage room in thebasement, three levels
								underground. There was a plain closet set in the backof one of the rooms, and a hidden
								door in the back of that closet. Gavingrabbed a lantern from a hook, twisted the flint,
								and was gratified to see itlight instantly. He released the luxin he’d been holding into
								two puddles onthe floor that quickly dissolved—no need to terrify anyone he ran
								into—andslipped into the closet.
							</p>

							<p>
								The hidden door closed smoothly behind him. He opened the closetdoor. A hand’s breadth,
								then it stopped, blocked. With the light of thelantern only cutting through the little
								crack, he couldn’t see what theproblem was. He reached through the crack into the
								darkness. Polishedwood greeted his fingertips, smooth and straight, then more, right on
								top ofit. Chairs.
							</p>

							<p>
								Well, that was the problem of a super-secret door hidden in a disusedstorage room,
								wasn’t it? Sometimes people saw a disused storage room andthought it should be used to
								store things.
							</p>

							<p>
								Sighing, Gavin set down the lamp and braced his shoulder against thedoor. He pushed,
								hard, harder. The door slid another hand’s breadth or twoas the stacked chairs shifted,
								then stuck fast. He glanced at the lantern,drafted a green wand, and stuck a blob of red
								luxin to the end. He lit the redwith sub-red and poked his narrow torch through the gap,
								holding it high.He poked his head through the gap after it.
							</p>

							<p>
								The entire room was packed with furniture, as if half a dozen lecturehalls and dining
								areas had been cleared out and everything put in here. DearOrholam. Gavin swore quietly.
								The only clearance was down at floor level.The only way out was to crawl between the
								legs of the chairs and tables.
							</p>

							<p>
								There was nothing for it. Unless Gavin wanted to start a fire, draft hugeamounts, and
								obliterate everything in the room so he could simply walk out—not terribly discreet—he
								was going to be mopping the floor with hisbody. Great. He let the luxin torch
								disintegrate and started crawling.
							</p>

							<p>
								Ten minutes later, he stood. He didn’t try to brush the dust from hisclothing. There
								wasn’t much point. He was muddy with dust, that’s howmuch dust there was, along with
								damp floors and sweat and dust heknocked off of the chairs and tables above him. He
								listened at the door for afull minute, heard nothing.
							</p>

							<p>
								Stepping into the hall lightly, he closed the door behind himself. Heextinguished his
								lantern with a puff; the halls were brightly lit. Even threefloors below the sea, the
								cherry glims (the red-drafting second- to fourth-year students) were expected to keep
								the lamps fueled with red luxin. Thestoreroom, wisely, was set almost at the end of one
								of the long hallways.Gavin ducked down to the lift at the end, mere paces away.
							</p>

							<p>
								The lifts had to serve the entire Chromeria, which meant they had to beserviceable by
								slaves or the dims, the newest students. So it was entirelymechanical. As anyone stepped
								into the lift, a scale would indicate howmany counterweights were needed. If a drafter
								chose to use lesscounterweight, she would have to pull herself up the rope, albeit only
								liftinga fraction of her own weight. If she used more counterweight than her ownweight,
								it could be difficult to stop at the correct floor. A central lift handledall the
								heavier loads and moved entire classes, while these side lifts tooksmaller loads.
								Additionally, each lift bay had numerous slots and ropes sothat ambassadors wouldn’t
								have to wait while dozens of dims made theirway to class.
							</p>

							<p>
								Gavin grabbed the second to the last rope. Secrecy meant he couldn’ttake the last one,
								though if someone saw and recognized him, they wouldwonder why he wasn’t taking the lift
								reserved for a man of his rank, so itwas probably a wash as to which way was more
								discreet. He drafted abrake, threw the lever to double his own weight, and kicked the
								release.
							</p>

							<p>
								He flew upward at great speed. Though he started deep beneath theearth, the lifts were
								brightly lit. At the top of each chute were holes to theoutside, and mounted there were
								highly polished mirrors from Atash thatsent natural light down the chutes for as long as
								the sun was visible to thatchute each day. Adjusting the mirrors every few minutes was
								another funjob for the dims, and every evening they would have to crank all
								thecounterweights back into place. Gavin could remember doing that himself.As memories
								went, it wasn’t a terribly pleasant one.
							</p>

							<p>
								The lift didn’t go all the way to his chamber near the top of the
							</p>

							<p>
								Chromeria, of course. That would be far too convenient—or, as theBlackguards preferred
								to say, insecure. No reason to give assassins a directpath to the Prism or anyone else
								important. Instead, after whizzing upwardat high speed halfway up the Chromeria, zipping
								past students andmagisters and servants and slaves so fast that they had no chance to
								see whowas in such a hurry, Gavin threw the brake.
							</p>

							<p>
								He stopped at the top of the chute and stepped out in front of the guardstation that
								protected this floor. There were four men here, guards, notBlackguards, all looking up
								from their dice guiltily. Apparently they hadn’tnoticed the whizzing rope until too
								late. Their mouths hung open at thesight of him, Gavin Guile himself, sweaty, dirty, and
								here.“Tell you what,” Gavin said, tucking the brake into his belt. “You keepthis quiet
								and I will too.” He stared significantly at their dice and the coinson their table.
								Guarding the lift at this high a floor had to be boring, butLuxlord Black wouldn’t be
								pleased to learn that his soldiers were gamblingon duty.
							</p>

							<p>
								Four heads bobbed as one. Gavin stepped into the next lift, which wasright next to the
								one he’d exited, and got in his accustomed position. Thistime, he chose a more human
								speed.
							</p>

							<p>
								There were two Blackguards guarding the lift at his level, and these menweren’t dicing.
								They were barely even blinking. Both had their spears inhand, knees lightly bent,
								spectacles on.
							</p>

							<p>
								When the Blackguards were on duty, they were on duty.The men snapped salutes and slapped
								their spears crisply to theirshoulders, swiveling smoothly back into their spots. Gavin
								walked past andslipped into his room. A bit of superviolet dropped all the shades,
								givinghim light. He pulled a summons chain by his desk and walked over to hisbathtub.
								Today was going to involve a lot of diplomacy, but mostimportantly, it was going to
								involve his brother, and there was no way hecould appear before Dazen disheveled. It
								might be interpreted as weakness.He opened the tap, tested the water, and heated it with
								sub-red.
							</p>

							<p>
								He was starting to take off his clothes when the door opened and hisroom slave Marissia
								walked in. She’d been captured during the warbetween Ruthgar and the Blood Foresters.
								Like most of her people, she wasred-haired and freckled, eyes like jade. Karris had
								Blood Forester blood.Gavin had never thought it a coincidence that his room slave was a
								young,pretty girl from the Blood Forest. The White had hoped, doubtless, to dullsome of
								his appetites that had caused so much trouble before the war. Thegirl had even been a
								virgin when she came to serve him ten years ago,which meant that the Ruthgari who’d
								captured her had had more of a tastefor gold than flesh.
							</p>

							<p>
								Marissia helped him strip off his filthy clothes and piled them to takethem for
								laundering. Then Gavin stepped in the bath. “I have messages foryou,” she said. “Are you
								ready to take them?”
							</p>

							<p>
								Gavin held a hand out, telling her to wait, then sighed as he slipped intothe hot water.
								Messages, demands, barely a minute to think.“Call a meeting of the full Spectrum. When
								do you think is the earliestpossible, Marissia?”
							</p>

							<p>
								Marissia had already loosened the laces of her dress, and now she pulledit and her shift
								over her head, folding them right side out next to the tub. Ifthere was one skill
								Marissia hadn’t mastered in her ten years serving Gavin,it was pretending that the rest
								of the world ceased to exist when there wasthe possibility of making love with him. She
								would bathe with Gavin, shewould make love with Gavin if he wanted to, but she wouldn’t
								let her hairget wet, and afterward she would pick up her perfectly folded dress, slip
								iton in a moment, and be on to her next duty. Marissia was many excellentthings, but
								“abandoned to the moment” wasn’t one of them.“Luxlords Blue and Yellow are over on Big
								Jasper today,” she said,picking up soap and a washcloth. “Yellow has family visiting and
								is hidingout in one of the taverns. Black is working on his ledger and swearing atanyone
								within a league, and Red is likely in the kitchens. So far as I know,the others are in
								their normal places on Little Jasper.”
							</p>

							<p>
								For as pretty as she was—and how the White had obviously chosen herbecause she looked
								like Karris—the most surprising thing about Marissiawas how competent she was. She knew
								everything, and carried everythingshe knew right at her fingertips. Gavin had taken
								great care to win her fullloyalty, knowing there was no way he could keep his prisoner’s
								existencesecret from his room slave—not forever—and knowing full well that she’dbeen
								sent to spy on him by the White.
							</p>

							<p>
								Gavin’s options had been simple: to let a succession of room slavesparade through his
								chambers, getting rid of each quickly, hoping that theydidn’t have enough time to
								discover his secret, or win one’s loyaltycompletely. Karris didn’t like Marissia, but
								she ignored her. It would havebeen ten times worse if Gavin had a new room slave every
								month—anddoing so would doubtless also have meant that over time he was allowing aspy
								for every noble family to ransack his room and report the most intimatedetails about him
								to all the satrapies.
							</p>

							<p>
								Besides, he needed someone to throw bread down the chute when hewas gone.
							</p>

							<p>
								Still, the White had shown impeccable taste in choosing Marissia.
							</p>

							<p>
								Though her body was nearly as familiar as his own after ten years, it wasstill a joy to
								see her lean curves. She slid into the tub behind him, holdingsoap and a washcloth, and
								began washing his back and shoulders.“Tonight, then, after dinner. Let the White know I
								would like to see herin an hour.”“Yes, Lord Prism. Is there anything else before I give
								you themessages?”“Go ahead.”“Your father wishes to speak with you.”Gavin gritted his
								teeth. “He’ll have to wait.” He lifted an arm as
							</p>

							<p>
								Marissia scrubbed his armpit.“And the White wishes to remind you that you promised to
								teach thatcohort of superviolets when you returned.”“Oh, hell.” How’d she even know he
								was back?“Would you like me to wash your hair, Lord Prism?”Gavin wanted nothing more
								than to enjoy Marissia and then relax in ahot bath until evening, but there was
								something he had to do before hespoke with the White, before he met with the whole
								Spectrum, anddefinitely before he spoke with his father.“No time,” he said, trying to
								shut off the rising feeling of panic, ignoringthe tightness in his chest at the prospect
								of what he had to do.
							</p>

							<p>
								She soaped his chest, her body warm and slippery against his back. Soft,comforting. It
								was almost enough to relax him. She kissed the spot on theback of his neck that always
								made him shiver, and trailed her fingernailsdown his soapy chest, over his stomach,
								lower. She kissed his neck again,hesitated. A question in that pause.
							</p>

							<p>
								He made a plaintive sound. “No, no time for that either.” How well did
							</p>

							<p>
								Marissia know him? Often when there was no time for meetings or otherduties, there was
								still time for that.
							</p>

							<p>
								Often? Almost always.She squeezed him under the water, hesitated for a moment more, as
								if tosay, Your lips say no, but someone else says yes, please! But then she kissedhis
								neck again, a peck, and began scrubbing the soap off his body. “I’vemissed you greatly,
								Lord Prism,” she said quietly. She finished and steppedout of the bath. “I’ll lay your
								clothes out,” she said, toweling off briefly,then wrapping the towel around her waist,
								walking to a closet to selectclothes for him.
							</p>

							<p>
								He watched her appreciatively, then shook himself.I’m not going to be able to lace my
								pants if I keep this up.After she laid out his clothes, she came back to the bath as
								Gavin stood,but he waved her off, he could towel himself dry today. Marissia dried
								anddressed herself in about the time it took Gavin to pat his chest dry. Then shewent
								out.
							</p>

							<p>
								After getting dressed, Gavin opened the little service closet, carefullylifted the
								stacked, folded linens from the shelves, and walked them over toanother closet where he
								stacked everything carefully. He then lifted out theshelves themselves and slid them
								into a nook on the other side of the room.The result was an open space in a closet that
								barely came up to his chest.The process was slow, but the point was that no one ever
								discover hissecret. If someone came while he was gone, the room must simply lookempty.
								If they searched the room, they should find nothing that appearedout of the ordinary.
								That was worth extra time and inconvenience.
							</p>

							<p>
								Gavin drafted a blue-green board fit to his feet, shoulder width, with ahole in the
								center. Then, tucking a mag torch into his belt and clutching theboard in one hand, he
								stooped and stepped into the closet. He closed thedoor behind him. The floor beneath his
								feet clicked. In order to keep itsecret, he’d designed the floor not to open unless the
								door was shut.Hunched, he found the hook and pulled it up, threaded it through the hole
								inthe board, and wrapped it around his belt. He dropped the board and slid hisfeet into
								the slots on it. His design was based on the tower’s lifts, butsimplified because he had
								no one to maintain it, and no space forcounterweights. It was basically ropes into the
								darkness and a pulley at thetop.
							</p>

							<p>
								Now the terrifying part. Gavin edged the floor open farther—anddropped like a stone into
								the darkness.
							</p>

							<p>
								The pulley whizzed, but its high-pitched protests disappeared withinmoments as Gavin
								fell. There was no resistance at all. He fell faster, faster.He drew the blue mag torch
								and broke it against his leg. The lift shaft,which he had cut himself into the
								Chromeria’s heart, was barely a pace anda half wide. There was nothing to be seen except
								smooth cut stone and therope, one side whizzing up and the other side speeding down with
								Gavin.
							</p>

							<p>
								He reached to the rope brake at his belt, but his movement tilted theboard strapped to
								his feet, making one side touch a wall. The frictionyanked that side upward, slamming
								him into the rock on the other side. Thebrake went tumbling from his fingers—and landed
								on his board. Hesnatched for it. Missed. He drew his knees up, his back skidding along
								thesmooth wall, and grabbed the brake.
							</p>

							<p>
								As he stood back up slowly, he grabbed the hook, attached the board tothe brake, and
								threw the brake onto the whizzing lines. He squeezed thebrake, all too aware that if he
								didn’t brake quickly he might hit the bottomof the shaft at incredible speed, but if he
								braked too quickly he could breakeither the board or his own legs.
							</p>

							<p>
								His legs trembling from the strain of trying to remain standing as herapidly
								decelerated, he passed five broad white lines painted on all walls ofthe shaft. It was
								the warning that he was almost to the bottom. A momentlater, he passed four broad white
								lines. Still too fast. Three. Two.
							</p>

							<p>
								Okay, not too bad. One.He hit the ground with a surprisingly hard thump. His natural
								reactionwas to try to roll with the impact—which didn’t work well, given that
								therewasn’t any slack in the rope. He flopped over onto his back and rolled ontop of the
								mag torch. It burned through his shirt instantly.
							</p>

							<p>
								Gavin jumped to his feet with a yelp. Mercifully, the shirt didn’t catchfire. He
								examined the angry red burn on his ribs. Very painful, but not veryserious. He unhooked
								himself from the lift.
							</p>

							<p>
								The chamber at the bottom of the lift was only four paces square. Gavinsaw none of it.
								In the blue light of the mag torch, he walked to one bluewall. At his touch, it became
								translucent, but there was nothing behind it.Not yet. Slowly, ever so slowly, the
								chamber opposite lifted from its restingplace and spun into position.
							</p>

							<p>
								This was Gavin’s greatest work. He’d constructed it in one furiousmonth, sinking
								everything he knew into it. But whenever he called the bluechamber forth, his heart
								seized. And it did so today. The slow speed of theblue chamber’s lift and rotation was
								necessary so that the man insidewouldn’t even know he was moving.
							</p>

							<p>
								On the other hand, it gave Gavin five minutes with nothing to do butwait. It would be
								empty today. Dear Orholam. Gavin’s chest tightened. Itwas hard to breathe. The chamber
								was too small. There was no air. Breathe,Gavin, breathe. Paint that nonchalance on
								thick.
							</p>

							<p>
								Finally, the translucence revealed the smooth globe of the dungeon’sinterior. Opposite
								Gavin stood a man who looked much like himself, thoughthinner, less muscular, dirtier,
								and with longer hair.“Hello, brother,” Gavin said.
							</p>

							<p>
								Chapter 35“Now this,” Ironfist said, “is how you should be introduced to theChromeria.
								High tide and dawn.” He’d arrived before dawn, waking Kip tothe bewildered feeling of
								not knowing if it was morning or night. Kip hadonly slowly been able to get his bearings
								as the commander hustled himthrough the less-crowded streets, finally cresting this
								hill. “They call it theGlass Lily,” Ironfist said. “A rather softer name than it
								deserves, but thensteel isn’t transparent, is it?”
							</p>

							<p>
								As they crested the hill, on first glance, the Chromeria did looksomething like a
								flower. Six towers in a hexagon surrounded one centraltower. Because Little Jasper rose
								in altitude from south to north, the towersfarther away from Kip rose higher, though all
								were the same height frombase to tip. And each tower was completely transparent on its
								south side.Completing the odd flower imagery was the bridge, if it could be called
								abridge.
							</p>

							<p>
								The bridge crossing the ocean between Big Jasper and Little Jasper wasgreen, like a
								flower’s stem, heading right to the flaring towers and thebulbous walls that actually
								hung past vertical. But not only was the bridgegreen, it wasn’t supported by anything.
								It lay at the surface of the water. Itwasn’t floating, because it didn’t move with the
								waves, and the sea waschoppy on one side of it and much calmer on the other.“Why green?”
								Kip asked, trying to kick his brain into working. Wasn’tgreen flexible?“It’s blue
								reinforced with yellow. It only looks green,” Ironfist said,resuming his walk toward the
								bridge. Kip hurried to keep up, havingdifficulty gawking and walking at the same time,
								all tiredness fled.“Yellow?” Kip asked. “How does that work? The Pr—erm, my unclehasn’t
								told me anything about yellow.”
							</p>

							<p>
								Ironfist looked at Kip, his gaze heavy as a sledge. He didn’t answer, noteven when Kip
								shut up and walked quietly alongside him, lookingexpectantly up at the big man but not
								bothering him.
							</p>

							<p>
								Finally, Ironfist glanced at Kip. “Do I look like a magister to you?”“Just figured that
								you’re not much good as a fighter without your bluespectacles,” Kip said. Stop, you
								moron! Don’t—“So we might as well putyou to some use.”
							</p>

							<p>
								The Blackguard commander’s head snapped toward Kip. Kipswallowed. You deserve the
								crushed skull you’re about to get, Kip. You’rebegging for it.
							</p>

							<p>
								Then a small, unwilling smile crept over the commander’s face. Heguffawed. “When Orholam
								hands out the brains, the folks at the front ofthat line have to go to the back of the
								common sense line, huh?”“What?” Kip asked. “Oh.”He waited patiently, thinking that his
								joke would buy him an answerabout yellow luxin, but Ironfist ignored him. The perverse
								little grin on hisface told Kip that he knew Kip was waiting for an answer and was
								onlyholding his tongue because he didn’t want to start another topic. But Ironfistwasn’t
								going to give him the pleasure of winning an answer. Pudgy force,meet immovable mass.
							</p>

							<p>
								Within minutes, though, they had made their way onto the Lily’s Stem—or rather, into
								it—and Kip forgot whatever it was that he had asked. Thebridge was fully enclosed,
								albeit with blue luxin so thin it was almost ascolorless as glass. But beneath their
								feet, the bridge actually glowed. Kipshot a look at Ironfist.“No matter how often you
								look at me, I’m still not going to be amagister,” the big man said.“How about a
								guide?”“Nope.”“A polite host?”“Uh-uh.”A jackass? Kip’s mouth actually opened to say it
								when he noticed againhow thickly muscular Ironfist’s arms were. He closed his open mouth
								andscowled.“You were going to say something?” Ironfist asked.“Your name,” Kip said. “Is
								that common, among Parians?”“Ironfist? Far as I know, I’m the only one.”“That isn’t what
								I—” Oh, he was teasing.Ironfist smirked. “You mean to take a name that describes us?
								Verycommon. Some use our old tongue, but the coastal folk—my people—usewords that
								outsiders can understand. But the Ilytians do it too. To a lesserextent, the whole
								Chromeria does it. Gavin Guile is almost never calledEmperor Guile or Prism Guile. He’s
								just the Prism. Orea Pullawr is just theWhite. A lot of people think that meaningless
								names are the true puzzle.”“Meaningless names. You mean like Kip?”Ironfist cocked an
								eyebrow. Shrugged.Thanks a lot.The crowds heading to Little Jasper for the day didn’t
								even seem tonotice the wonder beneath their feet. The bridge was perhaps twenty
								paceswide and three hundred long from shore to shore. The surface was lightlytextured,
								but that barely interfered with its transparency, aside from somedirt. Kip could see the
								water right under his feet, not even a foot away,swelling up with every wave and gapping
								in between them. They were onthe side of the bridge with heavy seas, too—apparently here
								traffic traveledon the right, unlike at home, so waves crashed into the luxin right next
								toKip. After having been pulled in and pounded by those same waves, it madehim more than
								a little nervous. No one else seemed to even notice it.
							</p>

							<p>
								Then, at about the time Kip and Ironfist reached the middle of thebridge, Kip saw a
								monster wave coming in. Just in time to meet the bridge,trough met trough, peak met
								peak, and the wave loomed high—its heighteasily half again as tall as the bridge. Kip
								braced himself and took a deepbreath.
							</p>

							<p>
								He didn’t notice he’d clamped his eyes shut until he heard Ironfist’squiet chuckle. He
								opened his eyes as the last of the water sluiced off theoutside of the tube, harmlessly.
								The bridge hadn’t groaned, hadn’tshuddered, hadn’t even acknowledged the power of the
								wave that had justfully passed over it.
							</p>

							<p>
								A few passersby grinned knowingly. Apparently this was the kind ofjoke that didn’t get
								old.“Is this why—” Kip stumbled as he reminded himself to use the correctterm. “Is this
								why my uncle wanted me to come this way?”“Part of the reason, I’m sure. Anytime we have
								to deal with arecalcitrant king or satrap or queen or satrapah or pirate lord, we make
								surethey come across at high tide. It’s a good little reminder of whom they’redealing
								with.”
							</p>

							<p>
								Little reminder?The next wave crashed over the bridge as well, and soon even the
								wavetroughs were higher than the bottom of the bridge. By the time Kip andIronfist
								stepped off the bridge, it was half submerged in the sea.Unbelievable. Kip hadn’t grown
								up on the sea, but even he knew that thetide coming in so hard and high and fast was
								unusual. It made him wonderif there was some magic to that too. And through it all, the
								bridge didn’teven shudder. Some reminder.
							</p>

							<p>
								The bridge curved up before it spilled them onto the shore, of course,but when it did,
								Kip was finally able to start paying attention to theChromeria.
							</p>

							<p>
								The first two towers, to the right and left as one stepped onto Little

								Jasper, were set narrower than the back two towers, either to helpstrengthen the wall
								near the huge gate where it was most likely to beattacked or—
							</p>

							<p>
								Oh. It’s all about the light.As soon as Kip realized that, everything else made sense.
								Everythingabout the Chromeria was designed to maximize exposure to sunlight.Building on
								a slope meant that more sun could reach the lower levels of thenortherly towers and the
								yard. Having the first two towers of the hexagonset narrower meant that they didn’t cast
								shadows on the back towers. The“glass” northern walls and the north sides of each of the
								towers meant thatevery north-facing room got as much sunlight as they could use, while
								thesouthern rooms had opaque walls more amenable to privacy and comfort.Kip imagined
								that those with a stifling fear of heights might not do well insome of the Chromeria’s
								rooms—minimizing its footprint, and adding tothe flaring lily shape, all the towers
								except the central one leaned out. It wasno accident either; despite the lean, the
								floors were all level. Perhaps it wasthat the Chromeria needed more space than was
								available on the island, sothe only way to have more space was to make the towers extend
								beyond theisland. Perhaps it was simply because they could.
							</p>

							<p>
								Either for support or convenience, there was a lattice of translucentwalkways between
								each tower and its adjacent ones. Encircling the centraltower, halfway up, a clear
								walkway connected to the tower at two pointsand then radiated out to each of the other
								towers in turn. Kip could see thatthose enclosed walkways were filled with people making
								their way betweentowers. Doubtless it was much faster if you had business high in each
								towerto be able to travel directly rather than walk all the way down the stairs,cross
								the central yard, and then climb all the way back up. But the visualeffect remained. The
								air around the central tower, like a flower’s style, waskept uncluttered,
								prominent.“Each color has its own tower,” Ironfist said.“Thought you weren’t a guide,”
								Kip said before he could stop himself.
							</p>

							<p>
								He blinked. If he didn’t dislike pain so much, he would have physically bithis tongue to
								give himself a reminder.
							</p>

							<p>
								Ironfist simply looked at him.“Sorry,” Kip squeaked. He cleared his throat and said,
								deeper, “I mean,sorry.”
							</p>

							<p>
								Ironfist still looked at him flatly.“Let me guess,” Kip said, squirming, wanting to
								deflect Ironfist’sintense gaze. He pointed to the tower to the left of the gate they
								wereapproaching, then in a sunwise circle. “Sub-red, red, orange, yellow, green,and
								blue.” Blue was the last one, just to the right of the gate.“Good guess,” Ironfist said
								reluctantly.“So why do the superviolets get bent over the fence?” Kip asked.“Excuse me?”
								Ironfist’s voice pitched higher.“You know,” Kip said. What?Ironfist’s right eyebrow
								climbed.“Like for a whipping.”“That expression doesn’t mean what you think it means,”
								Ironfist said.Kip opened his mouth to ask what it did mean then, but could tell
								thecommander wasn’t going to tell him.“There are never enough superviolets to fill an
								entire tower, andsuperviolets can draft best if they are higher up. The quality of light
								there isbetter for their work, plus a good majority of their work is directly for
								theWhite. So they inhabit the Prism’s Tower, close to the top.”
							</p>

							<p>
								They walked to the great gates with hundreds of other people who werecoming, to work or
								conduct business. The gates were covered with beatengold, but were open, so Kip only
								caught a glimpse of the scene and figuresdepicted on them. The walls, however, were a
								wonder themselves. Itbecame obvious that blue luxin was their main element, but the
								luxin itselfcould be lighter or darker, and it apparently had to be mixed with
								yellow.For strength? That had to be it, given that the entire bridge was made of
								thatmix. But each wall of the hexagon was different. There were patterns ofblue and
								yellow and green throughout, and that wasn’t even including thetowers. While the north
								side of each tower was as close to perfectlytransparent as possible for maximum sun
								exposure, the rest was constructedto mark the buildings for their owners, so that even
								the untrained could tellwhich building belonged to whom. And, apparently, to show off.
							</p>

							<p>
								Every surface of the blue tower was cut like a giant sapphire so that theentire tower
								gleamed off a thousand surfaces no matter what angle you sawit from. The sub-red tower,
								over its base of interwoven blue and yellow andgreen, seemed to burn. Illusory flames
								licked up the luxin for ten andtwenty feet and occasionally threw sparks and flames even
								higher. All therest of the tower seemed to ripple, like the air over a fire.
							</p>

							<p>
								Kip stumbled as they entered the central yard. He looked at his feet.
							</p>

							<p>
								Great grooves cut the ground in a broad arc, connecting the gates. But thegates Kip had
								passed didn’t slide shut, they just shut on hinges, like normaldoors. He looked at
								Ironfist, confused.“Glass flower,” Ironfist said.“Huh?”“What do flowers do?”Look pretty?
								“Uh…”Ironfist looked pleased to have stumped him. “With regards to the sun.”“They
								open?”“And how would that work with a group of buildings?”Kip thought about it, and gave
								up.“It wouldn’t,” Ironfist said.“Oh. Then…”“Try again.”“Do you ever answer questions
								straight?” Kip asked.“Only to my superiors.” Which was, Kip realized, a straight answer.
								Hewrinkled his nose, too intimidated by Ironfist to point that out, but thetwitch at the
								corner of the big man’s mouth told him he knew. “Flowersfollow the sun from morning to
								night,” Ironfist said, perhaps by way ofapology.
							</p>

							<p>
								Kip looked at the tracks again as he and Ironfist approached the centralbuilding. Before
								the road came to the gate, it flared wide—so wide thatmost of it simply abutted the wall
								in a wide crescent. “You mean the wholething turns?” It was the only thing that made
								sense, Kip realized. If thebuildings were all transparent on the north side, they would
								only take fulladvantage of the sunlight in the middle of the day, but if the
								wholecompound turned, they would get maximum light from dawn until dusk.But all of it?
								Impossible!“Here we are,” Ironfist said.Kip swiveled his head back to the front as they
								stopped in front of ahuge silvery gate. It was as plain as everything else here was
								ornate.
							</p>

							<p>
								Two guards on either side of the gate, dressed in full mirror armor, eachwearing a sword
								and holding a matchlock musket nearly as tall as he was.“Commander Ironfist,” they said
								in greeting.“Finally,” Ironfist said, pushing Kip inside. “You are about to meet the
							</p>

							<p>
								Thresher.”
							</p>

							<p>
								Chapter 36
							</p>

							<p>
								Meetings with Dazen were always a practice in deception.
							</p>

							<p>
								Gavin’s tightened chest didn’t ease at the sight of his brother. He shouldhave killed
								him years ago. How simple that would have been. How simpleit still could be. All he
								needed to do was stop dropping bread down thechute. Just like that, his problem would go
								away. He thought of it everymorning, after every sleepless night. But this was his
								brother. He hadn’tkilled him in the heat of battle, how could he kill him in cold blood?
							</p>

							<p>
								Seven years, seven purposes.Three times now, he’d put “Tell Karris Everything” on the
								list. Not justabout loving her. About this. That Dazen wasn’t dead, that he was
								here.That so much was built on lies. She deserved to know; she could neverknow. Because
								if she knew, it might bring them reconciliation andhappiness together—or it might bring
								a new war to consume the SevenSatrapies.“Hello, brother,” Gavin said again. The air was
								cool on his skin, thescent of resin and stone inescapable. He braced himself for the
								response.His brother, after all, was a Guile too. And unlike Gavin, he had nothingelse
								to think of except what he would say to Gavin the next time he came tovisit. That, of
								course, and plot to escape. After sixteen years, most menwould have given up, but not a
								Guile. That was their legacy: absolute,unreasoning faith in their supremacy over other
								men. Thank you, father.“What do you want?” Dazen asked, his voice rough from disuse.“Did
								you know that during the war, I fathered a bastard? I just found outabout a month ago.
								As big of a surprise to me as to anyone, but all sorts ofthings happen during war, don’t
								they? Karris was furious, of course. Shewouldn’t share my bed for three weeks, but,
								well… making up with Karrishas always been so good that I almost want to fight with
								her.” He looked upand left and smiled for an instant, as if at a private memory.
							</p>

							<p>
								It was important to layer the lies with a Guile. In Gavin’s narrative to hisbrother over
								the years, he had established an alternate life. He and Karriswere married, but had no
								children—a nagging heartache, and a source ofconflict with Andross Guile, who wanted
								Gavin to put Karris aside and finda woman who could produce heirs. He leaked those
								details slowly,grudgingly, making his brother work to uncover them. Then, every
								time,Gavin could leak more information to see if his brother looked eitherconfused by
								the lies or contemptuous of them.
							</p>

							<p>
								Dazen had a nasty smile on his face. “So who was it? Do you even knowher name? Did she
								have proof?”
							</p>

							<p>
								He was fishing, hoping Gavin would give him something for nothing.
							</p>

							<p>
								And he would suspect Gavin if Gavin gave it to him. But Gavin wentahead. “His face is
								proof enough. He’s the very image of Sevastian.”
							</p>

							<p>
								Dazen’s face paled. “Don’t you bring Sevastian into your lies, youmonster, don’t you
								dare.”“We’ve adopted the boy. His name is Kip. Good kid. Smart. Talented. Abit awkward,
								but he’ll grow.”“I don’t believe you.” Dazen looked sick. He might not believe it, but
								hewas close. “Who’s the mother?”
							</p>

							<p>
								Gavin shrugged, as if it didn’t matter. “Lina.”“You lie!” Dazen snarled and slapped a
								hand against the blue luxinseparating them. “Karris would never take that harlot’s
								bastard!” It was realfury, after sixteen years bathing in placid blue light, something
								deep and hotand too instant to be false.
							</p>

							<p>
								Which told Gavin three things. But some purposes are best achieved bymisdirection. “She
								had a rosewood box,” he said, “about this long. Do youknow what was in it?”
							</p>

							<p>
								The expression on Dazen’s face told Gavin he’d made a mistake. Headpulled back, stunned,
								then confusion, hope, and finally laughter. There wasgenuine joy. Dazen kept laughing,
								shaking his head, prolonging the laugh,now, rubbing it in. He leaned against the blue
								luxin between them, butnaturally, confident. “Here’s what bothers me more than
								everything else,”Dazen said. “More than your betrayal. More than your murders. More
								thanthe cruelty of imprisoning me rather than just killing me. More than youstealing
								Karris. More than all the rest of it together. How is it that no onehas noticed?”“We’re
								not doing this again, dead man,” Gavin said. “You don’t want totrade, fine. I’ll be
								going.”“This is my trade. Let me hear you say it, and I’ll tell you all about
								thedagger.”
							</p>

							<p>
								Dagger? Dazen had dropped that tidbit deliberately. Oh, shit. Gavin hadoverlooked
								something. His chest tightened, throat clamped shut. It was hardto breathe, harder still
								to keep his face smooth.
							</p>

							<p>
								There was no one here. No one who could overhear if he said it aloud. Itwasn’t new
								information. If he could get new information for old, it wasn’t aloss. But it felt like
								one.
							</p>

							<p>
								Gavin moistened his lips. “My name is Dazen Guile, and I stole yourlife.”“How’d you do
								it, Dazen? How did no one notice?”I took your clothes and strode out of the flames at
								Sundered Rock. Myface was swollen from our fight. I’d already given myself your scar and
								cutmy hair like yours. I just started giving orders, and your people becamemine. “I just
								acted like a selfish asshole, and everyone assumed I was you,”he said, feigning
								nonchalance.
							</p>

							<p>
								The prisoner laughed, ignoring the last part. “Well, it’s a beginning.
							</p>

							<p>
								Feels good, doesn’t it? They say confession is good for the soul.”
							</p>

							<p>
								Dazen—Gavin!—snarled, “Now… about that dagger.”“It’s my vengeance, little brother,” the
								prisoner said. “It is the sweetsong of victory,” the prisoner said. “It is the sting in
								the night. Dryness inyour bones. Sleeplessness and terrors. It is your death and my
								freedom,Dazen. It is the end of all your lies.”“And apparently I’ve only heard the
								beginning of yours,” Gavin said,sneering. His brother was lying. Had to be. He was just
								trying to makeGavin worry. He was chained, not witless. Confined, not toothless.
							</p>

							<p>
								The real Gavin laughed. “No, you see, the beauty of it is that I don’thave to lie. What
								are you going to do, little brother? You don’t have thespine to starve me. No, you’ll
								just watch it coming. Death will draw hissword and you will stand and do nothing. It’s
								always been your way.” Helaughed again. “I have nothing more to say to you. Begone.”
							</p>

							<p>
								Dazen trembled. Every word his brother said touched some deeper well.
							</p>

							<p>
								The time Karris’s elder brother Rodin had sworn to beat Dazen, and Dazenhad stood still,
								waiting, not really believing Rodin would do it until it wastoo late. The terrible
								dreams Dazen had had as a child, and for which theelder Gavin had mocked him. Even being
								dismissed, as Dazen had alwayshated. Orholam damn him, Gavin had always known the cracks
								in hisarmor. Dazen shook his head.
							</p>

							<p>
								No, he was Gavin now. The mask had to be total, even in his ownthoughts. At all times.
								Dazen was another life. “Dazen” was the wretch onthe other side of the luxin now. Dazen
								was the weak bastard trying to angerhim so that Gavin would kill him. That’s all this
								was. The prisoner wasterrified, weak. He was a shell. He was trying to provoke Gavin to
								kill himbecause he couldn’t summon the courage to suicide. That was all.
							</p>

							<p>
								The man Gavin had once been would have killed the prisoner and beendone with it. In the
								war, Dazen had become ruthless. Dazen loved the clashof arms, the splash of blood. Dazen
								loved his mastery over other men.Dazen would crush those who rose against him. Now, as
								Gavin, hewouldn’t be pulled back to that. He wouldn’t give his brother thesatisfaction.
								“Well,” Gavin said. “It was a pleasure as always, but it’sgetting late”—of course, it
								was barely noon, but he liked making the realGavin wonder just how disoriented he was
								down here—“and Karris is eagertonight. She made me promise not to keep her waiting.”
								That’s for cheatingon her and leaving me with the mess, you bastard. “So a good evening
								toyou, Dazen.”
							</p>

							<p>
								The prisoner said, “Your lies are failing already, Dazen. You just keepwondering who
								already knows, and how they’re plotting against you. Sweetdreams.”“There are worse
								things than waking from a nightmare to find yourselfin the arms of the woman you love.
								Say, waking in a cell. Sweet dreams toyou too, brother.” Gavin touched the glass and it
								went dark, and once morethe cell began its slow, slow rotation into the earth.
							</p>

							<p>
								Gavin leaned against the cold wall, trying to calm his racing heart. Itwasn’t a loss;
								he’d learned some things from his brother. First, he hadindeed been cheating on Karris.
								Kip was Gavin’s bastard. Second, Gavinhad known Kip’s mother—and she wasn’t a
								prostitute. If she had been, hewould have said, “Karris would never take a harlot’s
								bastard.” Instead, he’dsaid, “That harlot’s bastard,” which meant he intended the word
								as a slur,not a description. Third—unless he was far, far smarter than Gavin gavehim
								credit for, which was possible—the real Gavin still wasn’t gettinginformation from the
								outside.
							</p>

							<p>
								That was why Gavin had put all of this lies all in the past tense: Kip’sdiscovery. A
								month of not sharing a bed with Karris, decisions alreadymade about raising Kip. If
								someone were passing him news, the prisonerwould be confused by the chronological
								disparity—which, because it didn’tseem to serve a purpose, he wouldn’t expect to be a
								lie. Gavin didn’t expecthis brother to voice his confusion, of course, but he was hoping
								to see it inhis eyes. There had been none.
							</p>

							<p>
								So Dazen wasn’t getting information from the outside, which meant hewasn’t plotting with
								this “Color Prince,” whoever the hell that was. So theColor Prince was merely using a
								retelling of the Prisms’ War to agitatedissent. All the world believed Gavin had won,
								and the Color Prince didn’tlike how things had turned out, so he was pretending to be in
								league withthe losing brother—whom he had no idea was actually alive. This ColorPrince
								was a liar and an opportunist then, not a zealot who knew the truth.
							</p>

							<p>
								Which meant there was only one place the Color Prince could be: Tyrea.
							</p>

							<p>
								Either King Garadul was the Color Prince himself, or the two wereconnected.
							</p>

							<p>
								Thank you, brother. Very helpful. And you used to be better at lying than
							</p>

							<p>
								I was.
							</p>

							<p>
								But after the prison finally settled into place, he checked and double-checked all his
								chromaturgy. Nothing was out of place. And yet, even as heascended up the shaft and out
								of the evernight he’d created down here forhis brother, he trembled. He was as trapped
								as Gavin was.
							</p>

							<p>
								I could just stop feeding him. I wouldn’t even have to do anything. Icould just take a
								vacation, tell Marissia not to drop the dyed bread down thechute while I’m gone. He’d
								simply… die.
							</p>

							<p>
								He remembered when they’d been children and Dazen had climbed thelemon tree to prove he
								could do everything his older brother could—andfallen. They thought he’d broken his
								ankle. Gavin had carried him all theway home. A small thing, for an adult, but Gavin had
								been reduced to tearsby the effort. But he refused to give up. His little brother had
								neverforgotten it.
							</p>

							<p>
								And now the little brother is going to kill that man in cold blood,without even having
								the courage to face him as he did it?
							</p>

							<p>
								Enough. All the world knows your brother is dead. You are all theyknow. Besides, you
								need your wits about you. You have to tell the Spectrumyou started a war. And then you
								need to convince them to fight it your way.
							</p>

							<p>
								I do have a chance. Just as long as the White’s in a good mood.Unless…Oh, Gavin Guile,
								sometimes you do play a deep game, don’t you? Hegrinned to himself. Seven years, seven
								goals. One impossible prize. A smallfailure could serve his greatest success.
							</p>

							<p>
								Gavin made it back to his room and was putting everything back inplace to disguise the
								door in the closet again when there was a sharp rap atthe door. He threw the closet
								closed as the White opened the door.“Good to see you, Lord Prism!” she said.Gavin was
								painfully aware of the mess in front of him and the burn onthe back of his shirt—a burn
								he had no good way to explain if she saw it.“And you, High Mistress,” he said, smiling.
								“Just the person I wanted totalk to, if we could meet in a few moments, perhaps in your
								chambers?”
							</p>

							<p>
								Orea Pullawr looked at him sharply. “I’m afraid that’s going to have towait. There’s a
								class waiting for you. A class you promised me you’dteach.” Her nose twitched. “Did you
								burn something in here?”“Um, yes?” Gavin said. It came out as a question. Damn it.“ ‘Um,
								yes?’ ”Gavin cleared his throat. “Yes.”She waited.He said nothing more.“Very well, then.
								Be like that. I thought you left to take care of that colorwight.”
							</p>

							<p>
								Ah, she was angry because she thought he’d neglected a mission whoseabandonment might
								mean people dying. And she would have been sure, itbeing a blue, that he would go
								immediately. And she didn’t know why he’dsummoned the Spectrum. The White didn’t like to
								be left in the dark.“Consider it taken care of,” Gavin said. Which she would interpret
								to behim blowing her off, but he didn’t know how to not tell her about theskimmer if he
								was fully honest.
							</p>

							<p>
								After showing it to the boy and Karris, it was a secret he couldn’t expectto keep much
								longer, but that would be a big conversation, and he wasn’tready for it yet.
							</p>

							<p>
								She lifted her eyebrows, like, You’re going to be dismissive, to me?
							</p>

							<p>
								A thought hit him. “The class is superviolets?”The White nodded, suspicious.“There’s a
								girl from Tyrea in that class, isn’t there? Alivia?”“Aliviana Danavis, from Rekton.”So
								he’d remembered correctly. A girl from Kip’s town. Perfect.He hesitated. Kip had said
								Corvan was there, but…“No relation,surely?”“Actually, she’s General Danavis’s
								daughter.”Gavin let the shock show as dull surprise, like he’d just heard aboutsome
								minor tragedy on the other side of the world. He’d heard the girl’ssurname was Danavis
								before, but he’d assumed it was some distant relation,if any. Corvan’s own daughter? And
								why had Corvan been living in thesame town as Gavin’s bastard? Coincidence? If so, that
								was a heavycoincidence.
							</p>

							<p>
								Regardless, it required Gavin’s attention, right away. “Huh. You’re right,
							</p>

							<p>
								I need to go teach that class. It’s a holy responsibility.” Juggling, alwaysjuggling.“I
								always distrust you when you get dutiful,” the White said.He smiled, blandly innocent.
							</p>

							<p>
								Chapter 37
							</p>

							<p>
								It seemed to Kip that the entire first floor of the Prism’s Tower was a jungleof
								benches, desks, signs, queues, and clerks. Obviously, the whole businessof the Chromeria
								passed through this room. There were queues for tradersseeking contracts for food,
								queues for traders delivering contracted food,the same for every other trade good Kip
								could imagine, queues for redressof grievances caused by Chromeria residents, queues for
								laborers seekingwork, queues for adjudicating fee disputes on Big Jasper. There were
								evenqueues for nobles—although there were many more clerks staffing that onethan any of
								the others. The room had a busy hum, but despite the crowd, itwas obvious that the
								Chromeria ran like a well-oiled mill. The people wereimpatient but not angry, bored but
								not surly.
							</p>

							<p>
								Commander Ironfist led Kip to a desk with a single clerk, and no queueat all. “All the
								rest of this year’s darks were admitted weeks ago.”“Darks?” Kip asked.“That’s what
								people like you are called. Unofficially. Supplicants,officially: you want to be part of
								the Chromeria, but you aren’t yet. Soyou’re a dark. Darks, dims, glims, gleams, beams.
								But you don’t need toremember any of that right now.”
							</p>

							<p>
								Kip opened his mouth, shut it. Ironfist said nothing until they reachedthe desk. The
								clerk, obviously daydreaming, sat bolt upright when henoticed Commander Ironfist.“Yes,
								Commander? How may I assist you?”“I have a supplicant for immediate testing.”“Immediate
								as in…”“Now.”
							</p>

							<p>
								The clerk’s throat bobbed. “Yes, Commander. Supplicant’s name?”“Kip. Kip Guile,”
								Ironfist said.The clerk grabbed his quill, began writing, got halfway, froze. “Guile
								asin…?”“As in, no one needs to hear it from you. Is that a problem?” Ironfistasked.“No,
								sir. I’ll just go talk to my superiors. You could go ahead up to thetesting room. I’m
								sure the testers will be along presently.” With a quick bobof his head, the clerk got up
								and ran to a back office.“I understand the rest, but what’s a glim?” Kip ask as they
								climbed thestairs together. He trod on his sagging pant leg, which had fallen lower ashe
								climbed the stairs, and he almost pitched forward on his face. He clearedhis throat and
								hiked up his pants. Life would be so much easier if he had awaist.“A glimmer,” Ironfist
								said.Ah, dark, dim, glimmer, gleam, beam. A light progression, then.Ironfist said, “Now
								quiet. This is supposed to be solemn. You go into theroom and don’t say anything until
								your testing is finished. Got it?”
							</p>

							<p>
								Kip almost said yes, then nodded instead. This might be harder than hehad thought.
								Ironfist gestured to the door, and Kip walked in. Ironfist closedthe door behind him.
							</p>

							<p>
								The room was utterly plain. One wall curved slightly inward, so Kipguessed that was the
								outer wall of the tower. Other than that irregularity, theroom was a square, ten paces
								wide, all white stone with a single wood tableand a single wood chair. The room was lit
								by a strange white crystal set intothe wall, the same kind Kip had seen in all the halls
								and even, now that hethought of it, in the great room downstairs with all the queues.
								Kip floppedinto the chair. It had been an exhausting week. Had it only been
								yesterdaythat he’d been skimming across the waves, that he’d tried to drown, tried
								tosail? Had it only been a few days since… No, Kip wasn’t going to thinkabout that. Too
								jagged. Too heavy. He’d be blubbering again if he wasn’tcareful.
							</p>

							<p>
								He’d been waiting for several hours when he heard the muffledexchange of angry words
								from the hall. That was definitely Ironfist, layinginto somebody. Kip swallowed hard. He
								wanted to get up and eavesdrop,but he knew that with his luck as soon as he got to the
								door it would open.
							</p>

							<p>
								Whatever the argument had been about, it was over as quickly as itbegan. The door didn’t
								open. Kip waited. And waited. He was just startingto get tired, eyes drooping, when the
								door popped open.
							</p>

							<p>
								A man of perhaps thirty, wearing red spectacles hung from a red cordaround his neck,
								came in. He was clearly furious. Apparently not the winnerof the argument, then. “Darks
								will stand!” he snarled.
							</p>

							<p>
								Kip shot to his feet. His chair skittered back, caught its legs, and wentcrashing to the
								floor. Kip flinched, smiled weakly in apology, and picked upthe chair.
							</p>

							<p>
								The man continued staring at him, his mouth a tight white line. He had alarge hooked
								nose and the deep olive skin of an Atashian, though he wasbeardless, but it was the eyes
								that captured Kip’s attention. The brown eyeswere interrupted by a hard circle of royal
								red in the middle of the iris.Scarlet streaks like sunbeams pierced the rest of the
								brown irises. Kip putthe chair back as he’d found it, looked back to the man, and got
								nothing, nohint of what he expected.
							</p>

							<p>
								Kip moved away from the chair. The man stared liquid hatred at him.“Sorry,” Kip mumbled,
								defensive.“Darks will not speak! Ignorant Tyrean trash.”“Oh, kiss my blubbery butt
								cheeks,” Kip said. Oops.He squeezed his eyes shut to curse himself, so he didn’t even
								see theblow coming. The fist cracked across his jaw, and the next thing he knew,he was
								on the ground, drooling blood.
							</p>

							<p>
								Kip was slow to anger. Usually. But he popped up to his feet almost asfast as he’d
								fallen, and the rage was there, everywhere. Everyone he knewwas dead. Everything he
								cared about was gone. He didn’t care if the draftertore him apart.
							</p>

							<p>
								But as he bounced to his feet, he saw the light in the drafter’s eyes. Doit! the man’s
								eyes said. Give me the excuse. I will bounce you out of theChromeria before you know
								what hit you.
							</p>

							<p>
								And like that, Kip’s anger dropped into a more familiar channel, and hehad control
								again. There was a footstep in the hall. “Good,” Kip said.“We’ve got something to build
								on there. A little clumsy for a kiss, but Iunderstand your eagerness. I’m sure with that
								ugly face you don’t get muchpractice. But I said kiss my butt cheeks. Butt cheeks. Butt
								cheeks, cheeks.”He gestured. “They’re different. Try again, this time with feeling.”
							</p>

							<p>
								The drafter’s face went from incredulity to rage. He stepped forward and—just as the
								door opened—buried his fist in Kip’s stomach. The drafter wasdistracted by the opening
								door and didn’t put his full weight into the blow,but Kip doubled up as if it were the
								hardest blow he’d ever taken. Hecrumpled and coughed blood, retching.“Magister Galden,
								what in Orholam’s name is going on here?”The drafter who’d hit Kip said, “I—I—He defied
								me!”“So you struck him? Like the benighted do? Get out. Get out now! I’lldeal with you
								later.”
							</p>

							<p>
								Magister Galden turned and stood over Kip. “I’ll remember this, and I’llfind you someday
								when there’s—”“So help me Orholam, if you threaten a student in my presence for yourown
								malfeasance, Jens Galden, I will strip you of your colors and put youoff Little Jasper
								this very hour. Test me. Please.”
							</p>

							<p>
								Magister Galden looked absolutely stricken. Like his life was fallingapart without
								warning.
							</p>

							<p>
								That embarrassment and pain could be turned to rage, oh so easily.Sometimes Kip
								frightened himself. Magister Jens Galden was standingbetween him and the man who’d come
								in the door. Kip couldn’t see theman, and that man couldn’t see Kip. All he had to do
								was give Jens Galdena big, triumphant smile and leave his stomach open. The magister
								wouldlose control—Kip knew all about losing control—and kick him. Kip wouldleave his
								stomach open, inviting it. Jens would kick him, and loseeverything.
							</p>

							<p>
								And for what, Kip? For having a temper and being an asshole? Kiphesitated. The man had
								made him furious, but that was too much.
							</p>

							<p>
								But if Kip didn’t smile, he’d have an enemy. An enemy he could destroyright now.
							</p>

							<p>
								Wherever that thought was going, he didn’t get time to follow it. Themoment passed. Jens
								Galden snarled and wheeled out of the room. Kip wasleft on the floor, the inside of his
								lips still lacerated, bleeding and painful.He’d done what was right; maybe he should
								have done what was smart.
							</p>

							<p>
								He picked himself up. The man who’d saved him was just poking hishead out the door after
								Magister Galden. He said, “Arien, I need you toconduct the testing.”
							</p>

							<p>
								A woman said, “Luxlord, I’m not a tester.”“And I don’t want to wait while a new one is
								summoned!” he saidsharply. “I’m supposed to meet with the Prism in half an hour. We need
								toget started now.”
							</p>

							<p>
								The luxlord came back into the room. He was a tall man, wearing Ilytianhose and doublet
								though his skin was olive like Jens Galden’s rather thandeep black. He was balding; his
								fringe of dark, wavy hair was streaked withwhite and brushed out long, halfway down his
								back. He was somewhere inhis fifties, fit, and wearing a heavy black woolen cloak
								embroidered withgold thread in intricate lattice. His fingers were burdened with wide
								goldrings and jewels of every color of the spectrum, oddly worn between theknuckles in
								the middle of his fingers rather than closest to his hand. But Kipwas learning to look
								at people’s eyes—and the odd thing about the luxlord’seyes was perhaps that they were
								normal. They were green; there was noforeign color shot through those eyes.
							</p>

							<p>
								The luxlord smiled. “No,” he said, “I’m not a drafter. The Black usuallyisn’t. My name
								is Carver Black. Luxlord Black, for most purposes.” Thename didn’t sound Atashian, so
								maybe he was Ilytian, but Kip guessed theman could just as easily have grown up here or
								anywhere. Obviously, therewas a lot of trade and movement among certain nations. Just
								not Tyrea.
							</p>

							<p>
								Kip moved to speak, stopped, pointed to his lips.“Yes,” the luxlord said. “You can
								speak. We’ll begin momentarily, assoon as Arien is ready.”“Um, nice to meet you, Luxlord
								Black. I’m Kip.”“And you, Magister?” Luxlord Black asked. “Are you ready?”“Yes,
								Luxlord,” she said. She sat at the chair, and the Black stood besidethe table. Kip came
								to stand in front of the table himself.
							</p>

							<p>
								Magister Arien was short and skinny, nervous around the Black, buthappy and cute. She
								looked up at Kip like she wanted him to succeed. Hetried not to let her orange eyes
								disturb him. “Supplicant,” she said, “I’mgoing to lay out a series of colored tiles,
								from one tone to another. You willarrange the tiles in order.” She smiled suddenly.
								“We’ll start easy.”
							</p>

							<p>
								With that, she opened a bag in her lap, rummaged through the tiles for abit, and
								extracted a black tile and a white tile. These she laid at the edges ofthe table. Then
								she laid a dozen tiles in various shades of gray in between.Kip quickly moved them into
								place from lightest to darkest.
							</p>

							<p>
								Arien said nothing, simply checked the backs of the tiles, made markson a parchment, and
								swept the tiles off the table and back into the bag. Thenshe laid out brown tiles, from
								a tumbleweed to sepia. This was harder, butKip swapped tiles quickly once more.
							</p>

							<p>
								The test was repeated with blues, greens, yellows, oranges, and reds.
							</p>

							<p>
								When Kip got the reds perfect, Arien pulled out a black bag, checked thebacks of the
								tiles carefully—shielding them from Kip’s eyes with a hand asshe did so—and lined up
								another series of reds, except this group had twiceas many tiles, so the gradations of
								color were much much finer. Scarlets,vermilions, strawberry, raspberry, cerise. Kip
								lined them up and only hadtrouble with one. The color at the edge of that tile was
								slightly darker thanthe color on its face. Finally he put it in its spot by the color on
								its face.
							</p>

							<p>
								She flipped the tiles over, and Kip saw that he’d put tile fourteenbetween tiles nine
								and ten. Arien winked at him apologetically, as if he’ddone better than she expected,
								despite failing.“That’s not right,” Kip said.“Silence!” Luxlord Black said. “I know you
								don’t know our ways,supplicant, but you will not speak during the testing.”“But it’s
								wrong,” Kip said.“I’m warning you.”Kip raised his hands in silent protest.Luxlord Black
								sighed. “Magister?” he asked. “Usually protests have tobe lodged after the test results
								are finalized, but apparently nothing is goingto go according to custom today. A
								judgment, please?”
							</p>

							<p>
								Arien flipped the tiles back over as Kip had had them lined up. Shecleared her throat
								awkwardly. “Luxlord, I’m sorry, I’m not a superchromat.I tried to tell you. I can’t tell
								the difference myself. The key says that the—”“The key is being challenged.” Luxlord
								Black scratched an eye with onefinger. “Half of women superchromats, and I choose… Never
								you mind. Goget a superchromat, Magister.”“Yes, Luxlord,” she said meekly.She left and
								the luxlord turned his green eyes to Kip. “Who are you,really? Why are you testing
								today? Why the special treatment? Where areyou from?”“I’m from Tyrea, sir. King Garadul
								wiped out my—”“King? What’s this about?”The door opened and Magister Arien came in,
								followed by a womanwho looked like a scarecrow. She was almost as tall as Luxlord Black,
								leanas a rail, with faded brown skin, bones sticking out at sharp angles,wrinkled, her
								kinky hair white and short with only a few wisps ofsomething darker clinging to the
								tips, the natural mahogany of her eyeseclipsed by orange and red in jagged starbursts
								through her irises, reachingalmost to the outer edge.“Mistress Kerawon Varidos, I’m
								sorry to disturb you,” Luxlord Blacksaid. He shot a look at Arien.“She was just in the
								hall; she asked what I was doing,” Arien saiddefensively.“Nearly bowled me over. What’s
								this challenge?” the old woman asked.
							</p>

							<p>
								The tiles were lying face up the way Kip had left them. “How did thesupplicant order
								them?”
							</p>

							<p>
								Silence. The mistress looked from Luxlord Black to Magister Arien.“That is the way he
								ordered them,” Arien said.“So he’s a freak to his gender. Are we done?”“The key says it
								should be like this,” Magister Arien said. She turnedthe tiles over and pointed to the
								numbers on the back.“You come to me to differentiate the finest red chroma and you think
								Ican’t read?” Mistress Varidos asked sharply.
							</p>

							<p>
								Magister Arien looked horrified. Her mouth opened and shut.The old scarecrow picked up
								tile fourteen in her bony claws. She turnedit and looked at the edges. “Strip your
								tester of her position,” she said. “Thistile has been left in the sunlight. It’s been
								bleached. It’s the wrong color.The boy’s a superchromat.” She turned to Kip.
								“Congratulations, freak.”“Freak?” Kip said.“Simple, is he? Too bad.”“What?” Kip asked.
								He still hadn’t figured out what everyone’s titlesmeant, much less what he was supposed
								to do with all of this.“Kip, you’re forbidden to speak!” Magister Arien said.“That’s an
								injunction against cheating,” Luxlord Black said. “For whenhundreds of supplicants are
								testing in the same room.”“He just came today,” Magister Arien told Mistress Varidos.
								“The Prismhimself ordered that he be tested immediately. He doesn’t know all
								therules.”“Continue the testing,” the mistress ordered.Kip and Magister Arien glanced at
								Luxlord Black. Kip guessed that,technically, the luxlord was the highest-ranking person
								in the room, but theman gave the tiniest shrug, as if it wasn’t worth fighting over. Go
								on, hewaved.
							</p>

							<p>
								Magister Arien sat once more, pulled out a set of tongs, and used themto lay out another
								dozen tiles—except these were all the same deep red. Kipblinked. Magister Arien handed
								him the tongs. Um, thanks?
							</p>

							<p>
								Kip reached a hand out for a tile, and then he understood. He could feelthe heat
								radiating off them. He was supposed to see the differences in heat?He stared as if by
								sheer willpower he could tear the truth out of the tiles.
							</p>

							<p>
								Time crawled past. Kip started to daydream. He wondered if Liv
							</p>

							<p>
								Danavis was here. Oh, no, he’d have to tell her.
							</p>

							<p>
								Hi, Liv, great to see you. Your father’s dead.Fantastic. Kip thought about the flames
								roaring through his town, aboutthat drafter and his apprentice, throwing fireballs.
								Jumping over thewaterfall, running down the waterfall path in the utter darkness,
								relaxing hiseyes so he could actually see better than focusing directly. Oh, Orholam,
								Iam simple.“Okay, that’s long enough,” Luxlord Black said.“No wait! Wait! I just—I
								just…” Kip stared at the tiles again. Relax,eyes, come on! He let his focus go soft, and
								abruptly it was clear. Using thetongs, he shuffled each tile into its correct place in
								moments from thehottest to the merely warm. This was what Master Danavis had
								beenteaching him? The old dyer had never let on that what he was showing Kipwasn’t
								normal. Unbelievable.
							</p>

							<p>
								The thought of the dyer left a hollow in Kip’s stomach. Master Danavishad been good to
								him. Inventing chores he probably could have done fasterhimself, just to give Kip a
								little money. And like everyone in Rekton, he’dbeen slaughtered.
							</p>

							<p>
								Kip hoped Master Danavis had taken some of the bastards with him.“Are we almost done?”
								he asked roughly. He wanted to be alone. Hewas too tired, his emotions erratic, the
								reality of what had happened inRekton trying to rush in and overwhelm him now that he
								had a secondwhere he wasn’t running from soldiers or bandits or having magic thrown
								athim.“No,” the old scarecrow said. “Don’t bother, girl,” she told Arien, who’donly
								flipped over half of the tiles. “He got them all correct. Show him thesuperviolets.”
							</p>

							<p>
								Magister Arien put away the hot tiles with a glance at Luxlord Black,who seemed unfazed.
								Then she pulled out the last tiles, which were all thesame deep violet.
							</p>

							<p>
								Relax my eyes to see one side of the spectrum, so… Kip tightened hiseyes as hard as he
								could, and the colors leapt apart. Someone had written aletter on each tile. It read:
								“Nicely done!”
							</p>

							<p>
								Kip laughed. He slapped them into place.Magister Arien looked at Mistress Varidos. “Why
								are you looking at me,you fool girl?” the old woman asked. “I can’t see superviolets.
								I’m at theother end of the spectrum.”
							</p>

							<p>
								The younger woman blushed and flipped over the tiles. They were in thecorrect
								order.“Congratulations, boy,” Mistress Varidos said. “You can be somesatrap’s
								gardener.”“What?” Kip asked.“It’s one use for excellent color matchers, and a step up
								for you,
							</p>

							<p>
								Tyrean.”
							</p>

							<p>
								The door opened and Commander Ironfist stepped in. “What’s this?” heasked.“We’ve just
								finished testing the supplicant,” Magister Arien said. “He’sa full-spectrum
								superchromat!”“You’re wasting his time with tiles? I don’t care what colors he can see,
							</p>

							<p>
								I want to know what he can draft. Where’s that idiot tester I started with? Itold him to
								put Kip through the Thresher.”“You’re putting a raw supplicant through the Thresher?”
								Mistress
							</p>

							<p>
								Varidos asked.“Wait, this wasn’t the Thresher?” Kip asked.“Do you feel threshed?”
								Ironfist asked.“You’re putting a raw supplicant through the Thresher?” the mistressasked
								again.“He’s leaving in the morning. The Prism demands to know hiscapabilities before
								they go.”“This is highly irregular,” the mistress said. “Who is this boy?”“I’m right
								here,” Kip said, irritated.“Regular or irregular is irrelevant,” Ironfist said. “Can you
								and thismagister assist in the testing or not?”“Me?” Magister Arien asked, alarmed. “I
								don’t think I—”“We can do it—” the mistress began.“Good, then—” Ironfist said.“—but I
								demand to know who he is first.”“I’m right here!” Kip said.“Don’t you raise your voice
								to me, boy,” the mistress said, stabbing theair in front of his nose with one bony
								claw.“Who are you, boy?” Luxlord Black asked quietly, even as the voicescontinued to
								rise.“I think I’d really prefer not to help with the Thresh—” Arien wassaying.“You have
								no standing to make demands, Mistress—” Ironfist wassaying to the old woman.“I’m Kip
								Guile!” Kip shouted. “I’m Gavin Guile’s bastard, Kip.”Silence.Kip looked from one face
								to another. Luxlord Black merely lookedshocked. Magister Arien looked stunned to the
								point of tears. CommanderIronfist looked peeved. Mistress Varidos looked oddly
								satisfied. “Ah,” shesaid. “Then we’ll start the Thresher immediately. Girl,” she ordered
								Arien,“go get the room ready. Summon the testers.” She looked at Kip. “So,maybe not a
								gardener after all.”
							</p>

							<p>
								Go bend yourself over a fence, Kip said—but only to himself.
							</p>

							<p>
								Chapter 38
							</p>

							<p>
								Liv Danavis climbed the last steps to the top of the Chromeria, glancingaround
								nervously. She was at the head of the short line of her classmates,carrying her chair
								awkwardly high so she didn’t catch it on the steep stairs.At first she thought the deck
								was empty, then she saw him. Her target. Herlast chance.
							</p>

							<p>
								The Prism was standing right at the edge of the building, leaning out,looking east, past
								the red tower, studying the ships in Sapphire Bay. ThoughGavin Guile was literally twice
								Liv’s seventeen years, he cut a fine figure inthe afternoon sun. A sharp V from broad
								shoulders to narrow waist, armthick with muscle where the wind was blowing one sleeve
								up. His copper-colored hair streamed in the wind. He had that odd combination
								uncommoneven among the high houses of the Seven Satrapies of red hair and—insteadof the
								freckled skin that would mark him a Blood Forester—deeply tannedskin. Could it be true?
								Could this man be Kip’s father?“Liv! Move!” Vena hissed.Liv started. She’d stopped right
								at the top of the steps, blocking the restof the class. She hurried forward, blushing.
								She knew it was bad whenoblivious Vena noticed something. Perfect. Liv was going to hear
								aboutthis. If not from Magister Goldthorn, certainly from a few of the lessfriendly
								girls in the class.
							</p>

							<p>
								As the six girls took their places—there were no boys in the class—the
							</p>

							<p>
								Prism saw them. He pulled himself away from the edge of the tower andwalked to the head
								of the class. As when they sat in their normal class—though mercifully the days of solid
								book learning were mostly past—Livtook the second row, her Poor joining her friend
								Vena’s Oblivious Artist and
							</p>

							<p>
								Arana’s Plain Merchant’s Daughter. The girls who somehow embodiedbeautiful, rich,
								connected, noble, preening, and gifted into only three bodiestook the front row, as they
								always demanded. Magister Goldthorn, barelythree years older than her disciples, did
								everything those girls wanted.
							</p>

							<p>
								Gavin Guile came to stand in front of the class. “Hail, disciples,” hesaid. It was the
								traditional teachers’ greeting.“Hail, Magister,” they said in unison, answering without
								thinking aboutwhether they actually should address him by some other title. He was
								thePrism, after all.“Good,” he said, giving a lopsided grin. Orholam, he was cute.
								“Today, Iam only a magister. And you are only glims.”“Gleams,” Liv corrected without
								thinking.She shrank into her chair as Magister Goldthorn hissed and all the girlsturned
								disbelieving stares at her. Correcting the Prism! He could say up wasdown and everyone
								should nod and smile. But he didn’t look upset. He juststared at Liv for a long moment
								with those unsettling prismatic eyes.“Ah, yes,” he said. “Well, since you are advanced
								students, I supposeyou have questions for me? What’s your name?”“Me?” Liv asked. Of
								course he meant me, he’s looking right at me.“Um, Liv.”“Umliv?”She blushed harder.
								“Aliviana. Liv. Liv Danavis.” Had she added thatlast part hoping he would notice?
								Wouldn’t she have just said Livotherwise? Was she trying ingratiate herself, just as her
								Ruthgari masterswanted?“Well done,” Beautiful whispered from the front row. “Only took
								youthree tries.”“Related to General Danavis?”Liv swallowed. “Yes, sir. He’s my father.”
								Committed now. Well done,
							</p>

							<p>
								Liv.“He was a good man.” He said it as if he genuinely respected the manwho’d been
								responsible for so many of his own men’s deaths.“He was a rebel.” She couldn’t keep the
								bitterness out of her voice.
							</p>

							<p>
								Bitterness that her father had lost everything in the war, including hermother.
								Bitterness that she was always going to be different. Bitterness thather father never
								spoke of the False Prism’s War, never even tried to justifyfighting for the wrong
								side.“And not many of the rebels were good men, making your father evenmore remarkable.
								Do you have a question, Aliviana?”
							</p>

							<p>
								All the students were supposed to have prepared questions, but
							</p>

							<p>
								Beautiful, Rich, and Connected in the front row usually dominated any timethe class had
								with important drafters, so Liv hadn’t expected to get thechance to ask hers. She
								hesitated.“I have a question,” Beautiful said. Her real name was Ana, and sheleaned
								forward eagerly, crossing her arms under her breasts. It wasreasonably warm on top of
								the Chromeria, but Ana had to be cold,considering how little of her body that dress
								covered. The combination ofAna’s frustratingly effortless natural beauty, short skirts,
								and deep cleavagewas rarely lost on male magisters.“Wait, I do have a question,” Liv
								said. She’d already brought up that shewas Corvan Danavis’s daughter. The only way she
								could be moreinteresting to him—and make him suspect more that she was a spy—was
								byvolunteering that she was from Rekton and knew Kip.
							</p>

							<p>
								And the only way out was to go much, much further. Dear Orholam,please…“Yes, Liv,” Gavin
								said. But he didn’t look at her. Face expressionless, hewas staring hard at Ana. He
								glanced down at her propped-up cleavage thenback to her eyes and shook his head just a
								fraction. Yes, I see. No, I’m notamused.
							</p>

							<p>
								Ana blanched. Her eyes dropped, she sat up and shifted in her chair topull her skirt
								down. Thank Orholam Liv was in the back row, because shecouldn’t suppress her grin,
								despite everything.“Liv?” Gavin asked, turning those prismatic eyes on her.
								Entrancing.She cleared her throat. “I was wondering if you could talk to us aboutuses of
								yellow/superviolet bichromacy.”“Why?” Gavin asked.Liv froze. Her prayer was answered. A
								chance.Magister Goldthorn interjected. “How about we talk aboutsuperviolet/blue
								bichromacy instead? It’s far more common. Three of mydisciples are bichromes. Ana here
								is nearly a polychrome.”
							</p>

							<p>
								Gavin ignored her.Liv hadn’t thought this moment would ever come. She’d been trappedso
								long in this class, with these girls. In one more year, she’d be finished. Infact, she’d
								mastered enough drafting that she could take the finalexamination right now and pass
								easily. She hadn’t because there wasnothing good waiting for her when she finished. A
								terrible positiondecoding official, non-secret communications for the Ruthgari noble
								whoheld her contract. She wouldn’t even be trusted with secretcommunications. No matter
								that she’d been a babe in arms during the warand felt no loyalty to the rebels, she was
								Tyrean. It was enough to curse herin the Chromeria’s eyes.
							</p>

							<p>
								Each of the Seven Satrapies was responsible for the tuition of its ownstudents. It was
								an investment every satrapy gladly made because drafterswere so vital to every part of
								their economies, their armies, theirconstruction, their communications, their
								agriculture. But Tyrea hadnothing. The corrupt foreign governors of Garriston sent a
								pittance everyyear. Those students who came from Tyrea mostly had to pay their ownway.
								The Danavises’ wealth had been stolen during the war, so Liv hadneeded to pledge her
								services to a Ruthgari patron just to stay at theChromeria.
							</p>

							<p>
								If Liv were from any other satrapy, her ambassador would have forcedher patron to pay
								for bichrome training for her or surrender her contract.But there was no Tyrean
								ambassador anymore. There was an officialbursar’s purse for “hardship” cases like hers,
								but it had long ago become aslush fund for bureaucrats to reward their favorites. Tyrea
								had no voice, noplace.“Liv asked because she’s a yellow/superviolet bichrome,” Vena
								said.Gavin turned and looked at her. Vena was an artist and dressed like one.
							</p>

							<p>
								Boyishly short hair, artfully disheveled, lots of jewelry, and clothing she’dtailored
								for herself. Half the time you couldn’t even tell what country’s styleshe was borrowing
								from, if any. But despite not being pretty, she wasalways striking and—in Liv’s opinion
								anyway—looked great. Today, Venawore a flowing dress of her own invention, with silver
								embroidery at thehem reminiscent of the Tree People’s zoomorphic designs. The designs
								inthe visible spectrum were echoed cleverly in the superviolet.“What a marvelous young
								woman you are,” Gavin said to Vena. “And agood friend. I love your dress.” As Vena
								blushed crimson, Gavin turned toLiv. “Is this true?”“No, it’s not,” Magister Goldthorn
								said. “Liv’s Threshing wasinconclusive, and since then she’s shown no further
								abilities.”
							</p>

							<p>
								Liv pulled out the broken yellow spectacles—really only a monocle—that she’d bought
								secretly two years before. She held it up, squinted throughone eye, and stared at the
								white stone of the Prism’s Tower. In a moment,yellow luxin filled her cupped hands.
							</p>

							<p>
								It sloshed like water. Yellow luxin’s natural state was liquid. It was themost unstable
								of any luxin, not just sensitive to light but also to motion. Atits best, it could be
								used mainly for two things: if held with will in liquidform, it made great torches. Or,
								in a thin, sealed sheet, it would slowly feedlight to other luxins, keeping them fresh
								the same way that lanolin andbeeswax rejuvenated leather.
							</p>

							<p>
								Liv threw the cupped liquid aside. It didn’t even make it to the ground,instead
								flashboiling in midair into pure yellow light.
							</p>

							<p>
								Magister Goldthorn spluttered, “This is outrageous! You are forbiddento draft—”“You are
								forbidden,” Gavin interrupted her, “to squander the gifts
							</p>

							<p>
								Orholam has given you. You’re Tyrean, Aliviana?”
							</p>

							<p>
								Magister Goldthorn stopped cold. One did not interrupt the Prismhimself, not
								twice.“Yes,” Liv said. “Little town not far from Sundered Rock, actually.
							</p>

							<p>
								Rekton.”
							</p>

							<p>
								His eyes seemed to flash for a second, but it might have been Liv’simagination, because
								he said, “How long before you pulled the threshingrope?”“Two minutes five seconds,” she
								said. It was considered a very longtime.
							</p>

							<p>
								He looked hard at her. Then his expression softened. “As stubborn asyour father, I see.
								I barely made it past one. Well done. So… supervioletand yellow. Watch this.” He held
								out both of his hands.
							</p>

							<p>
								Every girl’s pupils tightened to tiny apertures. Superviolet luxin wasinvisible to
								normal sight. Even a woman who could draft supervioletwouldn’t see it unless she was
								looking for it. “Your normal lessons havecovered—doubtless to the point of your
								nausea—crafting missives withsuperviolet luxin.”
							</p>

							<p>
								Had they ever. Its invisibility was why superviolet drafters were used
								forcommunications. But on top of that, every satrapy was also looking intociphers and
								methods of stacking, twisting, and obfuscating the superviolet-written messages, locking
								the messages into fragile loops that would bebroken by any but someone who knew the
								exact method to open and readthem. Fun, for a while. But they’d passed the fun place a
								long long timeago.“You know what superviolet is great for?” Gavin asked.
								“Trippingpeople.” Every girl in the class grinned guiltily. All had done that at onetime
								or another. “No, seriously. The pranks are where you learn to applyyour color in ways no
								one else has thought of. You have to be a little bad tomake history. Sealed superviolet
								isn’t as strong as blue or green, but itweighs almost nothing, and for Orholam’s sake,
								it’s invisible!” Gavindrafted a hollow superviolet egg the size of his hand. He winced
								for aninstant, as if something was paining him. “The trick with yellow, Liv, is
								tounderstand how it releases its power. So, into the middle of this egg, draftliquid
								yellow.” He did. “The important bit is to leave absolutely no airinside the container.
								It has to be solid.” He closed it while looking at thegirls, not paying attention. He’d
								just left an air bubble in the egg. He hadn’tnoticed.“If it’s solid, totally airtight,
								then even if you shake it—”Liv raised her hand, opened her mouth, but she was too
								slow.Gavin shook the egg. It exploded with a blinding flash.Everyone hit the
								ground.Before Liv even opened her eyes, she heard Gavin laughing. Was heinsane? She
								looked up, but his hair wasn’t even ruffled. “Now,” Gavin said.“If that egg had been
								made of blue luxin, when it shattered we’d all havebeen cut to pieces. But as you all
								know in your heads—if not in your heartsor your bodies, apparently—sealed superviolet
								frays easily. Not that it can’tbe useful.” With a speed and facility that stunned Liv,
								he drafted anotheregg and filled it with liquid yellow luxin.“Get up,” he told the
								class. Ana was crying quietly. She’d scraped herknee when she’d fallen, and it was
								bleeding. Served her right for wearingsuch a short skirt. The rest of the girls got up,
								righted their chairs, and sat.Ana stayed on the ground. “Get up,” Gavin ordered her.
								“You’re going to bea drafter in a few months. You want to act like a woman? You’re not
								evenready to act like an adult.”
							</p>

							<p>
								The lash of his words hit Ana hard, but every girl in the class felt thesting. His
								statement was as true for Liv as it was for Ana. She looked awayfrom Ana, realizing how
								easy it would have been to be in her place rightnow. She felt a momentary twinge of
								compassion for the girl, then irritationthat she was feeling that. Ana had made her life
								miserable.
							</p>

							<p>
								Gavin promptly ignored Ana. He flung a strand of superviolet skyward.
							</p>

							<p>
								It was so light, it was caught in the wind and drifted to the west off thetower, but as
								long as he held the luxin open and supported it and draftedmore and more into it, he
								could send it higher, and he did, rapidly. Then hebrought the yellow egg up to the
								thread of luxin, made loops to hold it on tothe line, and then launched it into the air.
								His right hand snapped down withthe recoil of the launch.
							</p>

							<p>
								The egg zipped along the invisible line, curving out over the tower. Atits apex, two
								hundred feet out, it exploded with a sharp report. Far below,Liv heard people in the
								yard crying out in wonder and surprise.“Now, imagine I pointed that at a charging line
								of horses. It won’t killanyone directly, but horses don’t like having things explode in
								their facesany more than prissy girls do.”
							</p>

							<p>
								Blanching and blushing filled the sudden, pained silence.“There’s a couple of other
								special ways you can use superviolet in dual-color drafting. Anyone?” Gavin asked.
							</p>

							<p>
								Ana lifted her hand uncertainly. He nodded. “For distance control?”“That’s right. You
								have to leave your superviolet open, and the longeryou make the line, the harder it is
								to control. It’s like juggling when youcan’t see the balls. But…” He held out his hands,
								a swirl of colors wentthrough his eyes, and he was holding a red ball, a yellow ball, a
								green ball,a blue ball, and an orange ball. (Liv saw him wince again, as if he had
								apulled muscle in his back.) Then he started juggling. The girls—all of them,even
								Magister Goldthorn—gasped. First because the properties of the ballsweren’t right.
								Orange was slick, oily. Red was sticky. Yellow was liquid.Then, of course, because it
								was a different kind of impressive to seesomeone juggle five of anything.
							</p>

							<p>
								Oh. Liv got it. Every ball had a very thin blue luxin shell, filled withluxin of a
								different color.
							</p>

							<p>
								Gavin closed his eyes and kept juggling. Impossible. Was he justshowing off? No, he was
								showing off, but he was also still teaching.“Ah,” Liv said, pleased.“Someone got it,”
								Gavin said, opening his eyes. “With my eyes closed,how am I juggling?”“You’re the Prism.
								You can do anything,” someone mumbled.“Thank you, my butt hasn’t been kissed all day,
								but no.”Did he just say that?! “You’re not juggling,” Liv said, recovering first.Gavin
								took his hands away from the twirling balls. They kept going inthe same intricate
								pattern. Everyone tightened their eyes and saw thesuperviolet luxin connected in a track
								through the balls. The balls weresimply following the invisible track. “That’s right. If
								you give a visiblereason, even if it’s astounding, you can hide an invisible phenomenon
								rightunder people’s noses. That is the power of superviolet luxin. Tell you
								what,Aliviana, will you do me a favor?”“Sure.”He smiled. “Good. I’ll hold you to that.”
								He turned. There was a darkstain on the back of his shirt. Was that blood? Should Liv
								say something?“Magister Goldthorn, I’m sorry, but I have to leave. I still owe you half
								aclass, and I’ll make it up to you. In the meantime, if you’d notify theappropriate
								officials, Aliviana Danavis is hereby recognized as asuperviolet/yellow bichrome. Her
								instruction will begin immediately. Iwould be… disappointed if she were outfitted in a
								style less decent than theaverage Ruthgari bichrome’s. Costs should be taken from
								Chromeriafinances. If anyone has a problem with that, direct them to me.”
							</p>

							<p>
								Liv forgot about Gavin’s shirt instantly. She couldn’t believe what she’djust heard.
								With a few sentences, the Prism had changed everything. Freedher. A bichrome! In a word,
								she’d gone from a life writing letters for somebackwater noble to a life of only Orholam
								knew what. She thought she wasimagining it until she saw the exact same stunned
								expression on MagisterGoldthorn’s face. It was real. The second part of what he’d said
								took only amoment more to sink in. Liv was to be kept in a style equivalent to aRuthgari
								bichrome at the Chromeria’s expense. And the Ruthgari kept theirdrafters in more lavish
								apartments than anyone. It was all part of theirstrategy to attract the best talent.
							</p>

							<p>
								If Liv played it halfway right, she could escape that hellstone harpy
							</p>

							<p>
								Aglaia Crassos.
							</p>

							<p>
								Gavin smiled at her, a roguish, boyish joy mixing with something deeper
							</p>

							<p>
								Liv couldn’t read. Then he left.
							</p>

							<p>
								But watching him jog down the steps out of view, Liv was filled with avague unease.
								She’d gotten everything she hoped today, and everything thatshe hadn’t quite dared to
								hope. But something more had happened.
							</p>

							<p>
								The Prism had just bought her. She didn’t know why she was worth it,but it didn’t strike
								her as a random gesture. She looked at Vena, whoshrugged back, eyes wide. Gavin Guile
								had some purpose in mind for Liv,and she would perform it gladly. How could she not? But
								what was it?
							</p>

							<p>
								Chapter 39
							</p>

							<p>
								The cell’s blue was trying to sink into his brain, make him passionless,logical. No room
								for hatred, for envy, for fury. The dead man was mutteringin his wall.
							</p>

							<p>
								Dazen stood and walked over to him. The dead man resided in aparticularly shiny section
								of the blue luxin wall. He was, of course, Dazen’stwin.“The time has come,” the dead man
								said. “You need to kill yourself.”The dead man liked to drop a fire in Dazen’s lap and
								see what he didwith it.
							</p>

							<p>
								Dazen popped his neck left and right. The dead man popped his neckright and left. “What
								do you mean?” Dazen asked.“You haven’t been willing to do what you need to do. Unless
								you cancut deeper than Dazen, you—”“I am Dazen now!” Dazen snapped.The man in the wall
								smiled indulgently. “Not yet, you’re not. You’restill me. You’re still Gavin Guile, the
								brother who lost. Dazen stole yourlife, but you haven’t taken his. Not yet. You’re not
								ready. Talk to me againin another year or two.”“You’re dead!” Dazen snapped. “You’re the
								dead man, not me. I am
							</p>

							<p>
								Dazen!”
							</p>

							<p>
								But his reflection said nothing.His son was out there. His son, not the real Dazen’s.
								The real Dazen wasstealing his son. Just like he’d stolen his entire life.
							</p>

							<p>
								Gavin had decided long ago that if Dazen was going to steal his life, hewould steal
								Dazen’s in return. His younger brother had always been thesmarter of the two, so the
								only way to escape would be to become Dazen—to outthink his brother, to dig a pace below
								the real Dazen’s deepest trapand spring it back on him. So far, it hadn’t worked.“It
								hasn’t worked because you’re not willing to risk everything to win.
							</p>

							<p>
								That was Dazen’s genius,” the dead man said. “You remember the last timeyou two
								fought?”“When he imprisoned me and stole my life?”“No, the last time you fought with
								your fists.”Gavin couldn’t ever forget it. He’d been the older brother. He needed towin.
								He couldn’t even remember what they’d fought over. That hadn’t beenimportant. He’d
								probably started it. Dazen had been getting too big for hisboots for a while, not giving
								Gavin the respect he deserved. So Gavin hadpunched him in the shoulder and called him
								something foul.
							</p>

							<p>
								Though Gavin was older, Dazen had grown to be at least his size, if notbigger. Most
								days, Dazen would take the abuse with a complaint and acurse. Not that day. Dazen had
								attacked him, and suddenly Gavin had beenstruck with the fear that had been sneaking up
								on him for quite some time.What if he lost?
							</p>

							<p>
								They were struggling, trying to throw each other, raining punches toeach other’s arms,
								stomach, shoulders. Many were blocked, but even thosethat got through were more painful
								than damaging. Fighting your brotherhad rules. You didn’t try to break bones, you didn’t
								hit in the face. It wasabout submission and dominance and punishment.
							</p>

							<p>
								But if Dazen won one fight, things would never be the same betweenthem. That couldn’t
								happen. In his fear and desperation, Gavin punchedDazen in the face.
							</p>

							<p>
								It rocked Dazen back on his heels, but more from shock than from thepower of the blow.
								Dazen was usually pretty even-keeled, but as soon asGavin saw his face, he knew he’d
								made a mistake. A big one. The paindidn’t matter. The dominance didn’t matter. Not to
								Dazen. He’d goneabsolutely crazy. He didn’t even need to draft red to utterly lose it.
								And loseit he did.
							</p>

							<p>
								Dazen bulled into Gavin and swept him off his feet. Gavin tried to pullaway, dance
								aside, pull loose. But Dazen wasn’t jockeying for position; hewas taking Gavin down.
								They fell. Gavin landed on top of Dazen,connecting a good shot with his knee.
							</p>

							<p>
								It didn’t matter. It was like Dazen didn’t even feel it. He just absorbedthe shot and
								pulled Gavin with the force of his fall. Abruptly Gavin’s littlebrother was on top of
								him. Dazen grabbed his throat in both hands andsqueezed.
							</p>

							<p>
								Gavin’s panic receded. They’d both been taught grappling. He slugged
							</p>

							<p>
								Dazen across the jaw. Nothing. Dazen took it. The next punch Dazendeflected with an
								elbow. He squeezed.
							</p>

							<p>
								The panic came back with a vengeance. Dazen was going to kill him!
							</p>

							<p>
								Gavin punched and punched and punched, but Dazen just took thepunishment.
							</p>

							<p>
								Go ahead, hurt me, but I’m going to kill you.The world was going dark when Dazen
								abruptly released Gavin. Hestaggered to his feet as Gavin coughed himself back to life.
								By the timeGavin stood, his little brother was gone.
							</p>

							<p>
								After that, they hadn’t fought again. It was enough. They’d knownwithout saying a word
								that if they ever fought again, someone would likelyget killed.
							</p>

							<p>
								And if I’d won at Sundered Rock, someone would have been.But Dazen had let him live. It
								was like that moment when he’d had
							</p>

							<p>
								Gavin’s throat in his hands. He could have crushed me. He could havekilled me, but he
								let me live instead. Because he was weak.“If Dazen’s weak,” the dead man said, “what
								does that make you? Youlost to him.” He laughed.“Never again. It’s taken me this long,
								but I understand at last. I will takethis lesson from my brother: win at any cost. Be
								ready to pay it all, and youwon’t have to.” That was it. Simple. Now, now, Gavin was
								ready to becomeDazen. He would take Dazen’s strengths and leave his weaknesses.
							</p>

							<p>
								He reached out a hand and touched his reflection. “You really are a deadman now,” he
								said.
							</p>

							<p>
								His previous attempts to draft sub-red had failed because he couldn’t getenough heat.
								The only thing that generated heat down here was his ownbody, and he’d nearly killed
								himself last time when he’d taken too muchheat. He’d gone delusional, and still it
								hadn’t been enough. He hadn’t beenwilling to risk everything. He hadn’t been willing to
								die, if it took that. Hewas willing now.“Thank you, brother. Thank you, son,” he said
								aloud. He drafted a bladeof blue luxin. It only held an edge if he concentrated hard,
								but over a courseof days, he and the dead man shaved his long hair off. He would cut off
								ahank, separate the strands into narrow sheaves, and tie the ends of those sothey
								wouldn’t fall apart. When he had a good pile, smearing as much oilfrom his body on his
								makeshift yarn as he could, he began weaving. Thishad to be done first. Later he
								wouldn’t be in any shape to try it.
							</p>

							<p>
								For once, the blue helped him. The old him—back when he was free,back when he was
								Gavin—could never have done this. Threading the hairsover, under, over, under, making
								mistakes, starting over, fumbling anddropping the whole unfinished thing, trying to
								catch it and losing a week’swork in one second when his fingers pulled the threads
								loose—it all wouldhave driven him mad. But blue reveled in detail, in putting every hair
								in itsplace.
							</p>

							<p>
								Dazen didn’t even notice it at first, but one day he realized he hadsomething he’d lost
								long long ago. He had hope. He would get out. Heknew that now. It was only a matter of
								time. Vengeance was coming, and, iflong delayed, it would be all the sweeter for it.
								Dazen sighed, contented,and continued his work.
							</p>

							<p>
								Chapter 40
							</p>

							<p>
								Gavin tore off the stained shirt and grunted as he scraped the cloth acrosshis burn.
								Fifty danar shirt, and I ruined it in half an hour. Worse, he’dnoticed some of the girls
								glancing at the spreading stain. That wasn’t adisaster. They wouldn’t ask about it. One
								of the Spectrum would. He likedto save up his lies for them.
							</p>

							<p>
								He cursed under his breath.Gavin knew that Marissia must have some sort of an
								organizationalscheme to how she put away his clothing, but whatever it was, he’d
								neverpierced its logic. He rifled through stacks of shirts and pants and breechesand
								cloaks and habias and robes and thobes and petasoi and ghotras, mostof which he didn’t
								think he’d ever worn. Orholam, he had a lot of clothes.And these were only his summer
								clothes. He supposed it was because, asPrism, he was supposed to be of all peoples, so
								if he met with anambassador or needed to suddenly visit Abornea, he would already
								havelocal clothing that fit him.
							</p>

							<p>
								He was still standing bare-chested, ointment smeared on his burn—atleast he had the
								sense to keep aid supplies in his own room—when the dooropened. Marissia slipped in
								quietly. She glanced at the burn on his ribs. Herjade green eyes lit with anger, though
								Gavin couldn’t tell if it was at him orfor him. Maybe a bit of both. She grabbed the
								ointment from his table andsmeared more around to his back. Ouch. Apparently, he’d
								missed somespots. Then she bandaged him with a practiced hand. She wasn’t gentle.“Does
								my lord need assistance finding another shirt?” she asked.“Owww!” he yelped. He cleared
								his throat, lowered his voice an octave.“Please.”
							</p>

							<p>
								She went to a stack he swore he’d searched thoroughly and immediatelyplucked a shirt
								from its depths. He didn’t think he’d ever worn it before, butit was a style he liked,
								and dark enough that if the ointment soaked throughthis one, no one would notice.
								Marissia had a certain magic of her own. Hecould swear that shirt hadn’t been there
								before.
							</p>

							<p>
								She began whistling quietly as she dressed him and fixed his hair; it wasan old tune,
								pretty. Marissia was a good whistler.
							</p>

							<p>
								Oh, the tune was “Little Lamb Lost.” A comment on not being able tofind his own clothes?
								Probably. He had bigger things to worry about. He’ddealt with his brother, how much
								trouble could the Spectrum be?“I’ll be leaving either in the morning or the next day,”
								Gavin said.“There’s a young man testing downstairs. Kip. He’s my, uh, natural son.”There
								was no need to use the “nephew” euphemism with Marissia. Marissiaknew that Gavin had
								imprisoned his brother, but even she didn’t know thatGavin wasn’t Gavin. She hadn’t
								known either of them before the war, soshe didn’t need to know. He trusted her
								completely, but the fewer peoplewho knew that secret, the longer it would be before all
								this crashed down onhis head. “He’s sixteen—fifteen, I mean. Will you find appropriate
								clothesfor him and pack for both of us for two weeks?”“More for fighting or for
								impressing?”“Both.”“Of course,” she said flatly.On his way out the door, Gavin grabbed
								his sword in its jeweledscabbard. He wasn’t nearly the hand with a blade that even the
								least of theBlackguard was. He had been quite skilled once, but once he’d realized
								hecould draft any combination of color and instantly have a weapon ofwhatever kind he
								needed, he hadn’t practiced with plain steel as often aswas required to compete with
								professional warriors like the Blackguard.
							</p>

							<p>
								Of course, that assumed a fair fight, and there was no such thing with adrafter. The
								Blackguards themselves would fight with whatever was athand: blades, magic, a goblet of
								wine, or a faceful of sand.
							</p>

							<p>
								He tucked the Ilytian pistols into his belt too. Just to be an ass.When Gavin stepped
								out of his door, there were two Blackguardswaiting for him. His escort. It was his
								compromise with the White. He gotto travel without the Blackguard when he thought it was
								absolutelynecessary—so, most of the time—as long as he agreed to have them aroundwhen he
								was in a place where assassination was more likely. The Whitewasn’t pleased with how
								he’d interpreted their agreement, but he clungferociously to what little freedom he had.
							</p>

							<p>
								He strode quickly through the single hall that separated the halves of thislevel. He and
								the White each had one-half of the floor. Because of theChromeria’s rotation, Gavin’s
								half was always pointed toward the sun. Anodd irony that the White should be forever in
								shadow, though in her elderyears this White had appreciated it. It minimized the
								temptations of draftingand hastening her own death. Gavin wondered again how she did
								it.Without drafting, he would feel empty, weak. Life wouldn’t be worth livingwithout
								chromaturgy. It defined who he was. Surely it had done the samefor the White, and yet
								she lived on, her will still iron, her back unbowed.
							</p>

							<p>
								Stepping past the Blackguards guarding her room, he knocked on herdoor.“She’s not here,”
								the man on the left said. “The White has gone to meetwith the Chromeria. She thought it
								would be rude to keep the full Spectrumwaiting because of one man’s tardiness.”
							</p>

							<p>
								This was how the Blackguards registered their displeasure. His own
							</p>

							<p>
								Blackguards knew where he was going as soon as he turned toward theWhite’s room rather
								than toward the lift, but they didn’t tell him. TheWhite’s Blackguards knew where he was
								going as soon as they saw him,but they didn’t tell him the White was gone until he
								knocked, causing himto waste more time and be even later. One man’s tardiness? What’s
								theSpectrum going to talk about without me? I called the meeting.
							</p>

							<p>
								As was typical, the Blackguards were careful in showing their irritation.
							</p>

							<p>
								There would be no more trouble from them for a while, Ironfist would seeto that. If they
								peeved Gavin more than occasionally, he would do more toavoid them and they wouldn’t be
								able to do their job of protecting him.Still, they wanted him to respect them. Which he
								did, after a fashion.
							</p>

							<p>
								It’s an odd person who volunteers to jump in front of an arrow whenthey don’t even know
								if they’ll like the Prism or White that they’ll beassigned to guard. But he wouldn’t be
								chained. Power was freedom. Powerhad to be maintained.“If you can’t serve me well,”
								Gavin said to his own two Blackguards,“you can’t serve me at all.” He turned on his heel
								and started walkingtoward the lift.
							</p>

							<p>
								Of course they said nothing. They simply accompanied him on his leftand right. Commander
								Ironfist trained them to ignore orders that put theircharges in danger.
							</p>

							<p>
								Gavin waved his arms down, drafting bars of blue luxin strengthenedwith yellow down to
								his left and right. His Blackguards hesitatedmomentarily as he kept walking briskly, and
								he closed the gap in themiddle. He kept walking, not even looking back as he threw up
								walls ofsolid blue, red, green, yellow, and superviolet.
							</p>

							<p>
								It satisfied a small part of him. His brother really had gotten under hisskin. The
								bastard.
							</p>

							<p>
								But at the same time, this was necessary. The Blackguard had to knowthey couldn’t
								control him. That was how smart bodyguards worked: impedeyour freedom a little, then a
								little more, and soon they had their way. Gavinwasn’t going to let that happen. If he
								had the Blackguard hovering aroundhim at all times—as they ultimately wished—they would
								learn not just hissecrets like the skimmer and the condor, but his final secret. What
								wouldthe Blackguard do if they found out that Gavin wasn’t Gavin at all? Theymight
								decide he was the de facto Prism and that was enough. Or they mightdecide he was a
								threat to the real Prism. Or he might split the Blackguardinto warring camps. Pleasant
								thought, a bunch of elite warrior-drafterstrying to destroy each other. That was what
								made this necessary. TheBlackguard must be taught and taught again to accept the crumbs
								Gavin letdrop: You can protect me if you serve me wholeheartedly, and I’ll withdrawthat
								privilege whenever I please for any reason or none.
							</p>

							<p>
								At first, years ago, Commander Spear had punished those Blackguardswho let Gavin escape
								them. When that didn’t work, he’d made thepunishments public, shaming the Blackguards
								for that which wasn’t theirfault. Gavin had felt awful, and had not changed a bit.
								Commander Spearhad escalated the punishments, publicly flogging several men, including
								ayoung Ironfist. Gavin had responded by yawning and not letting anyBlackguards near him
								for a month. Then he’d walked through crowdedmarkets, leaving bound and gagged the
								Blackguards that Commander Spearsent, and he’d done it in the aftermath of the war, when
								there had been not afew men who would have gladly killed him.
							</p>

							<p>
								When there finally was an assassination attempt and no Blackguardspresent, Commander
								Spear had discharged the six Blackguards who weresupposed to be protecting Gavin. The
								White had finally stepped in anddischarged Commander Spear instead. Gavin hadn’t felt
								sorry for the man.Once he’d learned that using Gavin’s guilt against him wouldn’t work,
								heshould have tried something else. A man who couldn’t change tacticsshouldn’t be in
								charge of the Blackguard in the first place.
							</p>

							<p>
								The move hadn’t made Gavin any friends, but it had left him in charge.
							</p>

							<p>
								Besides, he didn’t need friends. The two Blackguards at the lift looked ateach other as
								he approached. The woman on the left was short but as thickas a bull. She said, “High
								Lord Prism, I notice you don’t have an escort.May I join you?”
							</p>

							<p>
								Gavin grinned. “Since you ask so nicely,” he said.They opened the lift for him, and in
								moments he was on the next levelbelow his and the White’s floor. The Blackguards on
								watch blinked at hissole escort. Doubtless they knew the guard rotation, and knew she
								wasn’tsupposed to be on Prism duty, nor was the Prism supposed to be guarded byonly one
								Blackguard.“High Lord Prism,” one of them said, a tall red/orange bichrome youthonly
								twenty years old, thus quite talented. “May I accompany you?”“Thank you, but no,” Gavin
								said. “You can’t protect me from what’swaiting here.”
							</p>

							<p>
								Gavin had told Kip that the White tried to balance the Prism’s power,but he didn’t like
								it much when she did.
							</p>

							<p>
								He stepped into the council room. The Colors were scattered around thetable. For formal
								events, they would sit in order around the table: Sub-red,Red, Orange, Yellow, Green,
								Blue, Superviolet, Black, Prism, White. Formeetings like this one, however, the pull of
								sitting by friends or the lure ofgrabbing one of the more comfortable chairs outweighed
								the naturaltendency to sit in the same spot every time. Gavin found the last
								spot,between the Superviolet, a tall, skin-and-bones coal-black Parian womannamed Sadah,
								and the soft, lighter-skinned Ruthgari man with the beadedbeard, Klytos Blue.
							</p>

							<p>
								Gavin had told Kip that each Color represented a country, and that wasmostly true. Each
								satrap or satrapah appointed one Color. It was the mostimportant decision most rulers
								ever made. But the system had begun tobreak down even before the False Prism’s War, when
								Andross Guile hadbribed and blackmailed his way into the Red seat, though the Blood
								Forestalready had one Color. He’d been so audacious, he’d stolen that seat fromRuthgar,
								claiming that the Guiles’ sliver of swampland in Ruthgari madehim eligible for the
								Ruthgari seat.
							</p>

							<p>
								Of course, after the war, similar logic had been used to deprive Tyrea ofa seat.
							</p>

							<p>
								There were so many interlocking and overlapping layers of loyalty itwas dizzying. Both
								the Red and the Green were Ruthgari and thus likely tounite on any issue concerning
								Ruthgar. But the Green was also cousins withJia Tolver, an Abornean woman who was the
								Yellow. The Aborneansstrangled both Parian and Ruthgari trade through the Narrows, so
								anythingto do with trade would see them at each other’s throats, but on anything
								elsethey might try to form a bloc. The Sub-red was a Blood Forester, who wereallies now
								with their stronger neighbors the Ruthgari, but her parents hadbeen killed in the war by
								the Green’s brothers. And on it went. Every noblefamily in the Seven Satrapies did
								everything it could to get at least one sonor daughter into the Chromeria, if for
								nothing else than to try to watch theirbacks.
							</p>

							<p>
								In turn, everyone in the Spectrum did all they could to protectthemselves. Family bonds,
								clan bonds, national bonds, color bonds, andideological bonds cut every which way. The
								Colors were political creaturesas much as they were magical. To be named a Color took a
								certain amountof chromaturgical aptitude—the White saw to that—but after that bar
								wasreached, not a few of these seats had found inhabitants at the same time
								thatdonkey-trains loaded with gold had made their way into royal houses.Gavin knew it
								had been thus when his own father had joined.
							</p>

							<p>
								The White, in her wheeled chair, said, “I call this meeting to order. Letthe record show
								that all Colors except for Red are in attendance.” Theyhated that. Hated that they
								couldn’t get rid of Andross Guile. They hatedthat in defiance of all convention, he
								hadn’t attended a meeting in five yearsbut still insisted that his votes be counted.
								They hated what his having hisvote delivered by messenger said about how little he
								valued their opinions.No eloquence would ever move Andross Guile. He would see and
								weighevery issue alone, and decide, regardless of the mummery of theseSpectrum meetings.
								But they feared him, too. The White said, “Lord Prism,you have called this meeting, so I
								turn over the proceeding to you.”
							</p>

							<p>
								She thought she was thwarting him. That he’d grown too independent.
							</p>

							<p>
								That he might become dangerous if she didn’t yank the leash.
							</p>

							<p>
								Careful, Orea. When choked, dogs go docile—but wolves go wild.Gavin’s relationship with
								the Spectrum had always been thorny. Ofcourse, when he’d been recuperating after
								Sundered Rock, they’d strippedhim of his title of promachos, taking control of the
								armies away from him,as custom dictated. But they hadn’t known whether he would allow
								it. Stilllearning his new guise, he had, but he didn’t care much for any of theColors
								personally. Nor did they care for him. He’d lived too long, becometoo powerful. He
								didn’t need them, and that scared them.
							</p>

							<p>
								They hated his father. They hated the Guiles, and they stymied Gavinwhenever they could.
							</p>

							<p>
								Patience, Gavin. Plenty of time for purpose six. Plenty of room tomaneuver. You are
								Andross Guile’s son.“We need to release the city of Garriston immediately, pull out all
								of ourmen, and give it back to King Garadul,” Gavin said. “Preferably with anapology
								that we didn’t do it sooner.”
							</p>

							<p>
								Silence. Followed by awkward silence.Klytos Blue chuckled uncertainly. When no one else
								joined him, he fellsilent.“King?” the White asked.“That’s what he’s calling himself.”
								Gavin didn’t elaborate.Sadah Superviolet said, “Surely you’re not serious, Lord Prism.
								Thegovernorship transfers to Paria in a few weeks. It’s our right. People havemade
								plans. Ships are sailing already. If we must have this conversation, letus have it two
								years from now.”“Absolutely not,” Delara Orange said. She was a forty-year-oldbichrome,
								with great sagging breasts and the red and orange in her eyespushing to the very edge of
								her irises. She was an Atashian. Atash got thegovernorship right after Paria’s. “Paria
								took the very first rotation, whenthere were actually a few treasures left in the city.
								And you looted it all.”“We also had to repair a city that had been burned to the ground
								and carefor its injured and ill. We took only what was an appropriate
								recompense.”“Stop,” Gavin said, before it could go any further. “You’re having thewrong
								fight. This isn’t about who has the governorship, in what order, orfor how long. It’s
								been sixteen years since we crushed Tyrea. They stilldon’t have a representative in this
								room. There are fewer Tyreans in theChromeria every year. Why is that? Have they
								suddenly stopped bearingdrafters there? Or is it because we have demanded a tribute from
								them soruinous they can’t support their drafters, which in turn impoverishes theirland
								further? Then we hold Garriston, their main port and their largest city,and your
								governors tax every orange and pomegranate and melon. I’ve beento Garriston, and it’s a
								shadow of its former greatness. The great irrigationcanals are full of sand. The fields
								are worked by women and children or noone, and there’s not a drafter to be found.”“You
								pity them?” Delara Orange asked. “When my brothers rise fromthe dead and the Castle of
								Ru is rebuilt, I’ll feel pity for Garriston. Theyjoined Dazen. It was their war that
								killed tens of thousands. I saw them castSatrapah Naheed’s two-year-old son down the
								Great Steps. I saw them cutopen her pregnant belly, take her babe, and make bets on how
								far down thesteps one of their men could throw the screaming child. They cut off
								thesatrapah’s nose and ears and breasts and arms and legs and threw her downafter. While
								we watched. The babe made it all the way to the last step, incase you’re curious. I got
								some of its brain on my dress. I wanted to try tocatch it, but I didn’t move. No one
								did. Those are the people you wish us tohave mercy on? Or maybe it’s the people who sank
								the entire refugeeflotilla, which had not a single drafter or armed man on board?”
							</p>

							<p>
								That was Gavin’s fault. As Dazen. He’d sent a young, new general, Gad
							</p>

							<p>
								Delmarta, who had always been efficient and direct. Gavin had told Gad tosecure Ru.
								General Delmarta had taken that to mean to secure it so thatthere could never be any
								resistance ever again. He’d exterminated the royalfamily—all fifty-six members of it and
								scores of their male retainers—publicly, one at a time, in the order of their
								succession, and burned downtheir great castle, the pride of Atash. When the people had
								fled, GeneralDelmarta had sent fire drafters after the flotilla. Gavin had only found
								outabout it afterward, and then what could he do? It was war, and his generalhad
								followed his orders, and when General Delmarta marched on the greatcity of Idoss next,
								it had surrendered without a fight because of their fear ofthe man, because of his
								cruelty.“Maybe,” Gavin said, “we could count how many children died whenyou burned
								Garriston in retaliation and barred the gates so no one couldescape? I seem to recall
								that all the Tyrean drafters and all but two hundredof the Tyrean soldiers were a
								hundred leagues away at the time. How longdid it take for the river to clear of bodies?
								So many little corpses bobbing inthe water. Even with all those hundreds of sharks
								turning the bay to bloodyfoam with their thrashing, it was weeks, wasn’t it?”
							</p>

							<p>
								Gavin had never learned whose idea it was, but when Garriston had beenburned, someone
								had stationed red drafters all around the walls. Soldiersshielded the drafters while
								they hurled red luxin back and forth in swathesthroughout the city. Red luxin was used
								as fuel for lamps. Spreadthroughout a city, it had made a hell for the residents of
								Garriston. Tens ofthousands had jumped into the river, and thousands more had jumped in
								ontop of them. Their bodies themselves had almost been enough to dam theriver in places.
								And then some of his older brother’s cleverer drafters hadfloated red luxin down the
								river in little boats of green or blue luxin, ormixed red and orange luxin to make a
								concoction so flammable it wouldburn even underwater, or mixed it with superviolet to
								make it float burningon the very water itself. Between the fire, the smoke, the water,
								the press ofthe crowds, the crushing deaths as whole buildings fell into the
								packedriver, and the fire floating down the river itself, there had been death on ascale
								no one had imagined before.
							</p>

							<p>
								Before the war, Garriston had been home to more than a hundredthousand people. His own
								conscriptions had thinned that to perhaps eightythousand. After the fires, only ten
								thousand remained, and after the firstwinter, only five thousand.“Enough,” the Black
								said. Carver was no drafter, and so in somerespects he was the weakest member of the
								Spectrum. As the Black, he wasresponsible for most of the mundane aspects of ruling
								Little Jasper:importing food, managing trade, awarding contracts, recruiting and
								payingsoldiers, maintenance for buildings and the docks, building ships, andeverything
								else that the White ceded to his control so she could focus onmanaging the Chromeria
								itself. But he was a formidable man, and Gavinrespected him. “We could list horrors all
								day, Lord Prism. What’s thepoint?”
							</p>

							<p>
								The point is, out of my five great purposes left, the only purely altruisticone is to
								free Garriston. Those people are suffering because of me, and youbastards have stopped
								every attempt I’ve made to help them.“The point is,” Gavin said, “that the Tyreans have
								as much reason tohate us as we have to hate them. We’ve been punishing them for the war
								forsixteen years. Most of the people paying the price now were children whenthe war
								started. They see no reason they should continue paying for whattheir dead fathers did
								or didn’t do. They hate us, and the fact is, none of us—none of the Seven Satrapies—want
								to go back there with an army.”“What are you saying?” Luxlord Black asked. “Do you have
								specificintelligence of a threat?”“I’m saying if we don’t pull out of Garriston and end
								the tribute on ourterms, King Garadul is going to take Garriston by force and end it on
								his.”That’s what King Garadul had meant when he’d told Gavin, “We’re goingto take back
								what you stole from us.” But Gavin couldn’t tell them aboutthat without revealing more
								secrets, and they wouldn’t believe it anyway.“I’m failing to see the humor here,” Klytos
								Blue said nervously. He wasa coward in a dozen ways, but Ruthgar wasn’t going to give up
								Garristoneasily, Gavin knew. “We’ve got a thousand soldiers and fifty drafters there.The
								drafters alone could hold off whatever army this ‘King’ Garadul couldraise.”“Knuckling
								under to a rebel, a man who declares himself a king—it’sunthinkable,” the Orange said.
								“He deserves death.”
							</p>

							<p>
								Oh, father, it’s too bad you never come anymore. You would enjoy this.
							</p>

							<p>
								I can do one thing that you never could.“First,” Gavin said, “us leaving is the right
								thing to do. We’re punishingpeople who have suffered too much already, and they hate us
								for it. We’vebeen planting the seeds of another war for the last sixteen years.
								Theystarted the war, yes. General Delmarta was born in Garriston, yes. But thatdoesn’t
								excuse us from what we’ve done, which is not just wrong, but alsostupid.”“Excuse me?”
								Delara Orange said. Her predecessor to the Orange—hermother—had been the architect of
								the rotating occupation scheme.“You heard me,” Gavin said. “We get almost no Tyrean
								drafters. Youthink that’s because none are born there anymore? Ha! What if, instead
								oftraining here, where they are poor and reviled and suspected as traitors,what if
								someone decided to train them closer to home? A new school, aChromeria dedicated to
								vengeance, started because of our pettiness andstupidity.”“Nonsense,” Delara said. “We
								would have heard of such a thing.”“But what if you hadn’t?” Gavin asked. “The quality of
								instructionmight not be as good as ours. I hope it wouldn’t be. But even with a
								fewrudimentary fire spells, how long could your fifty drafters stationed inGarriston
								hold out against several hundred? How long could your soldiershold out against thousands
								of rebels who could hide in plain sight amongthe locals? The fact is, King Garadul will
								take Garriston. He will demand it,on terms that he knows are insufferable, and then he
								will seize it. The onlyquestion is, will we lose and lose face and make King Garadul
								seem like awinner, and finally get drawn into a war your satrapies don’t have thestomach
								for, or will we forgo a tribute which—after it’s divided six ways—is insignificant, and
								give away that which we can’t keep? If we giveGarriston to King Garadul before he even
								asks, we look magnanimous. Ifwe give him an apology, we look moral, and if we do both
								before he asks,we deprive him of a victory and a cause.”“Do you have evidence of all
								this?” Delara asked. She was slippery, asoranges tended to be, but drafting red luxin
								made a drafter more aggressiveand reckless over time, too. “Because it seems to me that
								you would like usto give away an entire city for little reason otherwise. We don’t know
								thisnew King Garadul. He has only recently taken power. He hasn’t sent us asingle
								emissary, much less made demands.”“You’re telling me none of you have spies at Garadul’s
								side?” Gavinshot back.
							</p>

							<p>
								A few sardonic smiles and silence. No one was going to admit that, ofcourse. They didn’t
								trust each other enough. There had been no wars in thelast sixteen years, but that
								didn’t mean that everyone’s interests werealigned. The Chromeria and every capital was
								as full of spies as it had everbeen.“If you don’t,” Gavin said in an imperious tone sure
								to needle them, “getsome.”“High Luxlord, we take your advice to the satrapies very
								seriously, ofcourse—” Klytos Blue started to say. The Ruthgari hated Gavin, and hadsince
								he’d ended the war with the Blood Forest.
							</p>

							<p>
								Gavin cut him off. Time to play the hothead. “Listen, you morons. Idon’t know how you
								didn’t see this coming. Or maybe some of you did.Your loyalty is noted. The fact
								remains, this is rebellion and it’s heresy.King Garadul is talking about overthrowing
								the satrapies and the worship ofOrholam himself. I would have thought Orholam would
								command betterservice from his Colors.”“Enough! Enough, Lord Prism!” the White barked.
								She looked at Gavinlike she couldn’t believe what he’d said.
							</p>

							<p>
								Nothing like calling powerful men and women idiots, ingrates, disloyal,and impious all
								at once. Looking around the room, Gavin saw shock onsome faces and hatred on others.
							</p>

							<p>
								In the silence, Klytos Blue spoke first. He was a blue. It was onlynatural he should
								think things through faster than anyone else. “I believethat we should take the Lord
								Prism seriously. It’s only prudent that we servethe satrapies and Orholam as zealously
								as he does every day.” The wordswere delivered straight, but the malice couldn’t have
								been more evident. “Imove that we send a delegation to Garriston, to assess the threat
								from thealleged rebel Garadul and report back to us directly.”“A delegation?! Are you
								blind or stupid or corrupt?” Gavin demanded.“By the time they—”“Gavin!” the White said.
								“Enough!”She took the vote for a delegation to be sent and report back in twomonths’
								time. It passed, five to zero, with two abstentions.
							</p>

							<p>
								Gavin sat back in his chair, as if stunned, defeated. In the silence beforeanyone stood
								to leave, he shook his head. Said grimly, “I ceded power afterthe war, gave up the
								promachia. I became an adviser, when many wantedme to be an emperor in truth. And now
								you ignore me. Very well. But tellyour satraps and satrapahs this: Prepare for war. King
								Garadul won’t stop attaking Garriston. I guarantee it.”
							</p>

							<p>
								You see, father, this is the one thing I can do that you never could: I canhandle
								appearing to lose.
							</p>

							<p>
								Chapter 41
							</p>

							<p>
								Liv had barely seen her new apartments in the yellow tower before she’dgone out. Not to
								celebrate, not because she was impulsive, but because hercourage had been fading with
								every passing second. She’d been to half themoneylenders on the islands before she found
								one willing to do businesswith her.
							</p>

							<p>
								Stepping inside her new room, she found that the tower’s slaves hadbrought all her
								meager belongings over from the closet she’d called homefor the last three years. And
								there was a woman sitting on her bed.“Salvé, Liv, been out celebrating?” Aglaia Crassos
								asked.“What are you doing in my apartments?” Liv asked. “How’d you get inhere?”“It’s not
								good to forget your friends, Aliviana.” Aglaia stood and cameto stand a hand’s breadth
								from Liv’s face.“What? You’re here to threaten me? I’m shaking.”Something ugly crossed
								Aglaia’s face, but then was replaced by thatsmooth mask again, and that disingenuous
								laugh. “Careful with that sharptongue, girl. You may cut your own throat.”“I’m done,”
								Liv said. “Gavin Guile has—”“Bought you to be his bed slave. I heard.”“Go to hell!” Liv
								said.“You’re the one who’ll do that, seeing how you’re throwing yourself atthe man who
								murdered your mother and destroyed your country.”
							</p>

							<p>
								It was a tremendous slap. Liv took a step back.Aglaia had made a reference to the
								burning of Garriston before, but Livhad never heard anything remotely like that. In
								truth, Liv had no idea, butconsidering the source, she was willing to bet it was a lie.
								“The Prism didn’thave anything to do with that.”“And you know that because he said so?
								Your mother died in those fires.
							</p>

							<p>
								Your father led the fight against Gavin Guile.”“What do you care about Garriston?
								Ruthgar fought on the Prism’s side.
							</p>

							<p>
								Your father fought beside Gavin.”“And my brother is the governor of Garriston, so I’m in
								a position toknow things,” Aglaia said. She lowered her voice and leaned in. “Andmaybe
								now you are too.”
							</p>

							<p>
								So that was what this was about. “No,” Liv said. “I’m finished with you,with Ruthgar,
								and with your lies.” Fealty to One. That was the Danavismotto, with strong suggestion
								that it was fealty only to one. And Liv wasn’tabout to serve this one.“Welcome to your
								new life, Liv. You’re important now. You are a playerin the great game, and your hand
								isn’t all bad. You see, Liv, you might beTyrean, but no one’s going to hold that against
								you anymore. It will onlymake you more remarkable for overcoming such a handicap. The
								good lifecan be yours.”“You can’t buy me,” Liv said.“We already did.”“Things are
								different now. By the Prism’s own command.”Aglaia’s eyebrows rose slowly, making her
								horsey face seem evenlonger. It was a practiced gesture, but then, nothing about her was
								genuine.“I’ve been working with you for, what, three years now? And I went backthrough
								my notes. I never thought you were a thief, Aliviana Danavis. Butnow you’re abandoning
								your duty after three years of schooling. Threeyears we’ve supported your every
								need—”“Oh so generously, too!” Liv said.“If it had been more generous, your debt would
								be that much greaternow. Here’s my question, Liv. What kind of woman are you?”
							</p>

							<p>
								It was the same question that had put a quill in Liv’s hand to sign away afortune. With
								her new friendship with Gavin, she could probably tell theRuthgari to go bugger
								themselves. What could they say against the Prism’sdecision? And though Liv had gone
								from a nothing—a monochrometalented in a minimally useful color—to a bichrome, she still
								wasn’t worthfighting over. Plenty of each nation’s investments went bad. Drafters died
								orburned out, or switched loyalty in the last year of their training. Everynation tried
								to steal drafters, and the Ruthgari were more successful at itthan anyone else, so
								surely they wouldn’t fight too hard to keep Liv.
							</p>

							<p>
								But to be a Danavis was to act with honor. Always.“What do you want?” Liv asked.“You’ve
								been an embarrassment to me, Liv. The hardly talenteddaughter of a rebel general. But
								now you’re going to be a jewel in mycrown. You will be my vengeance on those who thought
								to slight me. Andfor that, I need you to be a success. You’ll already be collecting a
								generousallowance from the bursar out of the Chromeria’s general fund. Keep that,and
								we’ll pay you double as well. We’ll forgive your debt and the years ofservice you
								already owe us. Hell, if you play your cards right, you can drawallowances from three or
								four nations before you leave the Jaspers. Indeed,you won’t need to leave the Chromeria
								at all, if you serve us well. Thinkabout that: you can have a life here, at the center
								of the world, whereeverything important happens. Bed who you want, marry who you
								want,give your children every advantage you were denied. Or you can go servesome
								lordling somewhere, writing letters and examining his wife’s bed tosee if she’s faithful
								to him, hoping he’ll give you permission to marrysomeone you can tolerate. Out of all
								the nations, Ruthgar is the best toserve. And the worst to offend.”“But why do you want
								me to spy on the Prism? He’s never doneanything to offend Ruthgar.”“We like to keep an
								eye on our friends. It helps us remain friends—”“And yet you were just telling me how I
								could do this to hurt the manwho killed my mother. Which is it, Aglaia? Do you want me
								to betray himto hurt him, or it’s not really a betrayal at all because you aren’t going
								tohurt him?”“Well said,” Aglaia said. But then she continued, unflappable, “Thepoint is,
								you may be able to damage the man personally who is responsiblefor so much havoc in your
								country, but your interference, your betrayal—perverse girl, insisting on calling the
								service of your own country a betrayal—your ‘betrayal’ won’t result in war. These lands
								have seen enough ofthat.”
							</p>

							<p>
								It took Liv a moment to digest. It did make sense. In a way.“But this is impossible. I
								don’t know the Prism. He’s talked to me once.
							</p>

							<p>
								Once.”“And he liked you.”“I don’t know that I’d go that far.”“Do you have any idea how
								hard it is to get someone next to that man?
							</p>

							<p>
								We’re going to give you all this just for trying. Besides, we know he has aweakness for
								Tyreans.” A tiny, quick lift of her eyebrows showed that shewas honestly surprised that
								the Prism would have such bad taste. “Maybeyou can use this son of his to get close to
								him. We don’t care.”
							</p>

							<p>
								It was bad enough to be asked to betray the Prism, but to use Kip to getto him? No. Kip
								was a good boy. Liv wouldn’t do it. There was only oneway out of this, and she’d known
								it all along.
							</p>

							<p>
								Liv pulled out three coin sticks. “This is how much the Ruthgarigovernment has spent on
								my upkeep for the last three years. With interest.Here, take it. I’m done with you. I’m
								free. I don’t owe you anything.”
							</p>

							<p>
								Aglaia Crassos didn’t even look at the coins. She didn’t ask how Liv hadgotten so much
								money. In truth, it had taken signing over a writ to anAbornean moneylender that would
								allow him to receive her allowancedirectly, and a ruinous interest rate. Liv was a
								pauper once more. She’dhave to sell some of the marvelous dresses they’d given her just
								to stayafloat. “Liv, Liv, Liv. I don’t want to be your enemy. But now that you’refinally
								worth something, I’d swive a horse before I’d let you go. You have acousin who was here
								when you first arrived. Showed you how things workhere, yes?”“Erethanna,” Liv
								said.“She’s a green serving Count Nassos in western Ruthgar. She justpetitioned to marry
								some blacksmith. The count has put a hold on it—at myrequest.”“You…” Liv said,
								trembling.“Lovely couple, apparently. So happy together. Tragic if the countdecided the
								land needed Erethanna to marry another drafter to increase herodds of having gifted
								children.”“Go to hell!”“And your own studies can be opposed. And rumors can be started
								fromdozens of corners about all sorts of despicable things you’ve done. We canpoison any
								well when you finish your studies and are looking for work. Youcan’t stay under the
								Prism’s patronage forever. The second his eyes turnelsewhere…”“I’m not worth that much
								to Ruthgar,” Liv said, real fear constricting herthroat.“No, not to Ruthgar. But to me
								you are. Your attitude has made youworth my full attention. And if you make me look bad,
								I will make youmourn the day you ever met me.”“I already do.” Liv felt deflated. “Get
								out. Get out before I kill you withmy bare hands.”
							</p>

							<p>
								Aglaia stood, grabbed the money sticks, and said, “I’ll take these for mytroubles. After
								you’ve reconsidered, you know where to find me.”“Get out!”Aglaia walked out.Liv was left
								trembling. Not thirty seconds later, there was a knock on thedoor. That was it. Liv was
								going to kill her. She strode to the door and threwit open.
							</p>

							<p>
								It wasn’t Aglaia. A beautiful woman stood there. A Blood Forester, withthe oddly pale,
								freckled skin that still seemed strange to Liv even after yearsat the Chromeria, and red
								hair like a flame. The woman was dressed in aslave’s dress, but it was tailored to her
								lean figure, and a finer cotton thanLiv had ever seen any slave wear. A nobleman’s
								slave?
							</p>

							<p>
								The slave handed Liv a note. “Mistress,” she said. “From the High Lord
							</p>

							<p>
								Prism.”
							</p>

							<p>
								Liv Danavis stared at the note, feeling stupid, off balance. It read,“Please come see me
								at your earliest convenience.” Her heart leapt into herthroat. A summons from the Prism.
								So here it was, the beginning of herpaying her debt to Gavin Guile. She didn’t fool
								herself by hoping it wouldbe the end of it, too. When you owed a luxlord, you owed them
								forever.
							</p>

							<p>
								She just hadn’t thought he’d ask for her so soon.Oddly, the first thing she thought of
								was, What do you wear for anaudience with the Prism? Liv didn’t usually pay much
								attention to herchoice of clothing. Maybe that was because when you only have a
								fewchanges of clothes, you wear what’s clean and despair of ever wearingwhat’s
								fashionable. That, of course, had changed instantly. Gavin hadordered that she be kept
								in an equivalent fashion to a Ruthgari bichrome,and that meant lots of clothes, a few
								jewels, and this huge apartment—literally five times larger than the one she’d lived in
								for the last three years.And though she might not have any money, now she had makeup.
								Now shehad options, and she wasn’t sure she liked it. The idea of turning into aprissy
								girl like Ana made Liv’s stomach turn.
							</p>

							<p>
								The slave was still standing at the door, waiting to be dismissed with thepleasant,
								neutral expression of a woman ignoring the cluelessness of hersuperior.“Pardon me,
								caleen,” Liv said, “but would you help me?” Liv alwaysfelt awkward when it came to
								dealing with slaves. No one in Rekton hadbeen rich enough to afford one, and the few
								slaves that came throughworking with the caravans were treated the same as other
								servants. Thingswere more formal at the Chromeria, and most of the other students
								hadgrown up having slaves or at least being around them, so Liv always feltlike everyone
								else knew what to do, while she was all thumbs. She still feltweird calling a woman ten
								years her senior by the diminutive “caleen.”
							</p>

							<p>
								Of course, now that Liv was a bichrome, she was going to have to getused to it fast, or
								she was going to look like an idiot even more often thanusual.
							</p>

							<p>
								The slave cocked an eyebrow like any twenty-eight-year-old would atany
								seventeen-year-old being foolish.“I don’t know what to wear,” Liv said in a rush. “I
								don’t even knowwhat ‘at your earliest convenience’ means. Does that mean actually at
								myearliest convenience, or does it mean go right this moment, even if I werejust wearing
								a towel?”“You can take a few minutes to dress appropriately,” the slave said.Liv stood
								paralyzed. Was what she was wearing now appropriate?“Most women called to the Prism’s
								room wear something more…elegant,” the slave said, eyeing Liv’s plain skirt and blouse.
							</p>

							<p>
								Maybe the fitted blue dress, then. Or that odd Ilytian black silk sheath.
							</p>

							<p>
								But that was more of an evening dress, wasn’t it? Or should she wear theshockingly
								small… Liv wrinkled her nose. There was something about theslave’s statement that made
								her nervous. She could just imagine aprocession of beautiful women queued up outside the
								Prism’s door. Liv hadnever heard any gossip about who the Prism took to his bed, but she
								wasn’texactly in the middle of the juicy gossip circles, and she could certainlyimagine
								more than a few girls willing to dress or undress any way the Prismwanted. In addition
								to basically being the center of the universe, he wasgorgeous, commanding, witty, smart,
								young, rich, and unmarried.
							</p>

							<p>
								Whoever had packed her drawers with cosmetics had bought mostlyskin lighteners or
								darkeners. But with Liv’s kopi-and-cream-colored skin,she didn’t have a hope of looking
								as light as a west Atashian. Her eyes weretoo dark anyway. And with wavy hair, even with
								a darkener on her skin, shewasn’t going to look Parian. There was no hiding that she was
								Tyrean.
							</p>

							<p>
								All those other girls and women would look fantastic in their fancydresses and perfect
								makeup. They’d feel comfortable, beautiful. Liv wouldfeel like a fool and look like a
								tramp.
							</p>

							<p>
								How many of the women called to the Prism’s room had gone withulterior motives? How many
								had been acting for one country or another?How many of the ones who hadn’t been co-opted
								had gone with their ownagenda anyway? All of them? She wasn’t going upstairs to seduce
								GavinGuile—to hell with Aglaia and her ilk—so why should she make herselflook like she
								was?“To hell with it,” Liv said. She didn’t swear much, but it felt good rightnow. She
								threw down a dress that probably cost as much as she’d spent alllast year. “It’s
								convenient for me to go right now.”
							</p>

							<p>
								The slave looked like she wanted to speak, but she stopped herself.“This way, ma’am.”
							</p>

							<p>
								After they headed up the luxlords’ lift, the slave led Liv to the
							</p>

							<p>
								Blackguards stationed there. The woman of the pair searched Liv forweapons. Thoroughly.
							</p>

							<p>
								Liv couldn’t help but feel a little violated. “They take their job seriously,don’t
								they?” she said as they finally led her to what Liv assumed was thePrism’s door.“Do you
								have any idea what it would mean for the world if the Prismdied? He’s not always an easy
								man, but he’s a much better man than Prismsusually are. And there are many of us who
								would do anything for him.Anything. Remember that… ma’am.”
							</p>

							<p>
								Orholam’s prickly beard, but the slave woman was protective.The slave stopped at the
								door, knocked three times, and opened it. Livstepped into the Prism’s room and found him
								sitting behind a desk, staringat her. His eyes were entrancing. Right now, they looked
								like diamonds,scattering light everywhere. He gestured to the chair across from him,
								andLiv sat.“Thank you, Marissia, you may go,” Gavin said to the slave. Then heturned his
								diamond eyes on Liv and said, “It’s time for that favor.”

							<p>
								Chapter 42“Scout!” Corvan called. “She’s seen us. Sonuvabitch!”
							</p>

							<p>
								After Rekton, Corvan and Karris had decided to travel together. Bothwanted to go after
								King Garadul’s army, if for different reasons: Karris tojoin it somehow, and Corvan to
								see if he could find some way to exactvengeance. It was a risk to trust Corvan Danavis,
								of all people, but he hadsaved Karris and his reputation from the war was sterling.
								Truth was, it wasmore dangerous to travel alone.
							</p>

							<p>
								They’d been following King Garadul’s army south for days, and notonce had he put out
								scouts. He’d seemed so careless that now Karris andCorvan had walked right past a scout
								in a tree stand.
							</p>

							<p>
								As they stood at the edge of a wood, half a league behind the rear guard,the scout was
								sprinting to the east, down a slight hill, rather than goingstraight for the rear
								guard.“She’ll have a horse down in the gully there. You might be able to cuther off,”
								Corvan said. He was unslinging his great yew bow. “Shot’s too far.But I might get
								lucky.”
							</p>

							<p>
								Karris was already running. Away from the Umber River, Tyrea hadrapidly become a scrub
								brush desert. In a few spots fed by undergroundsprings, there were clumps of pine trees
								like the one she and Corvan hadjust left, but for the most part this land was rolling
								hills, often broken,something between a desert and a badland. It had made their pursuit
								ofKing Garadul’s army more and more difficult, because even though theywere traveling by
								foot and thus didn’t kick up the huge quantities of dustthat Garadul’s men and wagons
								did, they still could be seen. They had todecide at every hill whether they should go
								straight over and risk beingseen, or go around and lose even more ground. An army didn’t
								travel fast,but it did travel straight.
							</p>

							<p>
								The scout was a good two hundred paces in front of Karris. Judgingfrom the slight slope
								of the hill, and making a guess, Karris angled off tothe right. Probably the scout would
								make it to her horse, but if Karris werewithin a hundred paces when the scout mounted,
								she wouldn’t be mountedfor long.
							</p>

							<p>
								Something dove out of the sky and pierced the ground not five pacesbehind the fleeing
								scout. She didn’t even notice. Damn. Corvan had nearlyhit a sprinting target at two
								hundred fifty paces. That close and he couldn’thave gotten just a little closer?
							</p>

							<p>
								The woman turned and angled more to the right. Corvan’s second arrowmissed by a good
								fifteen paces, flying where she might have been if she’drun straight.
							</p>

							<p>
								Karris barreled on, heedless of the ground, hurdling tumbleweed andpraying that she not
								step on the infrequent tough cactus that grew so low tothe ground here that you never
								saw it until its spines stabbed through yourshoes. And that wasn’t as bad as the
								rattling snakes. At the speed Karris wasrunning, of course, there would be no warning
								rattle, just a strike. Shepushed harder. Maybe if she ran fast enough, even a striking
								snake mightmiss her.
							</p>

							<p>
								Out of the corner of her eye, she saw Corvan’s next arrow streak intoview. The shot was
								more than three hundred paces now, albeit with nowind, so Corvan was having to shoot
								halfway between the horizon andvertical simply for the arrows to make the distance. But
								this shot lookedperfect.
							</p>

							<p>
								It dove and the scout crashed into the ground, full speed. Karris couldn’tbelieve her
								eyes. An impossible shot. Three hundred paces at a runningtarget? She cut left, heading
								straight for the woman.
							</p>

							<p>
								Almost as soon as Karris turned, she saw Corvan’s arrow. Sticking outof the ground. Back
								where the scout had fallen. It hadn’t impaled her. It hadtripped her.
							</p>

							<p>
								Even as Karris saw it, she saw the woman standing, her head swivelingtoward Karris. She
								looked shaken, her palms bloody, a cut down the side ofher face, but the woman started
								running regardless.
							</p>

							<p>
								Karris had easily covered a hundred of the two hundred paces betweenthem, and as the
								scout had to go from a dead stop to sprinting, Karris madeup more than half of that. She
								wasn’t even thirty paces back.
							</p>

							<p>
								No more arrows fell. They were out almost four hundred paces now.
							</p>

							<p>
								Even with a yew longbow this was an extreme distance. There was no wayCorvan would risk
								an errant shot with Karris so close to their quarry.
							</p>

							<p>
								Karris fumbled with her necklace, trying to grab her eye caps. Evenbreaking stride that
								much gave the scout an edge, and she pulled away.Curse her, the woman ran like an
								antelope. But with the patience born ofexperience, Karris let her take the extra
								distance. Once she got the green-and-red eye caps on, the fight was over.
							</p>

							<p>
								She cracked apart the appropriate link of her necklace, watching theground in front of
								her, ripped the luxin off, and slowed for a few steps to getthe caps stuck perfectly
								around each eye socket.
							</p>

							<p>
								The scout cut hard left as the hill descended rapidly, shouting. Karriscame after her,
								filling her right arm with red luxin and her left with green asshe ran.
							</p>

							<p>
								The scout was shouting? To whom?Maybe she was shouting to her horse.Sure she is,
								Karris.In an instant, Karris was over the hill and barreling down the steep pathstraight
								into a camp. There were a dozen men waiting for her. At least twowith nets. Two with
								catchpoles. Cudgels, staves. Swords sheathed. Notwanting to kill, but capture. A trap.
							</p>

							<p>
								Karris felt sick horror, the shot like a fist in her gut. Like she was sixteenagain, her
								father dragging her to a boat, sailing away from Big Jasper. Herfather’s boat had sailed
								past the family mansion, where she’d secretly—shethought—agreed to meet Dazen. Her
								brothers were there, lying in wait.They’d said they were going to teach Dazen a lesson
								for trying to destroytheir family. But she’d seen murder in their eyes.
							</p>

							<p>
								She had been standing on the deck when an explosion had blown out allthe windows of her
								room on the second floor of the mansion. She sawfigures limned in fire, fighting.
							</p>

							<p>
								Something ripped off half the roof and explosion followed explosion.
							</p>

							<p>
								Bodies were hurled a hundred paces out into the water. Standing next to heron deck, her
								father paled. “You said he was coming alone, you stupid slut.Look what you’ve done! He
								must have brought an army!” Her father didn’tstrike her, just grabbed her head and made
								her watch what she couldn’thave torn her eyes away from if she tried. In minutes, the
								only home she’dever known was engulfed in flames.
							</p>

							<p>
								She’d been a child then. She’d been unable to think, unable to act. Shewasn’t a child
								any longer, and she had pools of rage to draw from that thatinnocent hadn’t known.
							</p>

							<p>
								Karris used the height disparity of coming down the steep trail to leap atthe first of
								the two horsemen who were side by side. He was holding acatchpole in both hands and he
								brought it up sideways, trying to block. Hecaught her extended foot, but she just let
								her kick collapse and slammedinto him with both knees.
							</p>

							<p>
								Ribs crunched as she swept him out of his saddle. She rolled as she hitthe ground, but
								had to catch herself with her right hand, which was holdingher narrow ataghan, so she
								drafted a thin blade of green luxin from her lefthand as she passed under the second
								horse. The blade passed through itsbelly easily.
							</p>

							<p>
								Karris was on her feet before the horse even reared in pain. She let thegreen luxin
								disintegrate as she charged one of the net men, switching hersword to her left hand. He
								was too stunned. He didn’t move, not even as shelunged full length, stabbing at his
								face, her right hand flinging a weak arc offire behind her for distraction. The net man
								still didn’t move, and her lungeconnected. The blade caught him between the eyes,
								skidded off the bone,and dove deep through his eye.
							</p>

							<p>
								Turning to follow the arc of fire she’d thrown, Karris saw a weighted netspinning toward
								her just as the arc of fire faded from the air. Perfect throw.
							</p>

							<p>
								But she waited, waited, switching sword hands again, until the net wasbetween her and a
								man swinging a staff overhead at her.
							</p>

							<p>
								With a snapping pop-pop, Karris shot out two horseshoes of green luxin.
							</p>

							<p>
								One whistled harmlessly through the twisting, expanding net. But though itmissed the
								net, the horseshoe did catch the staff-swinger in the cheek,blasting him off balance.
								The second horseshoe snagged the net as it passedthrough and whipped it back into
								several men, its leaden weights suddenlybecoming a flail.
							</p>

							<p>
								The horse was rearing now, screaming in pain, a hideous sound. Itsentrails spurted out
								in a bloody, ropy mass. But Karris barely heard it,barely saw it. She saw only chaos,
								and chaos was her friend, chaos was heradvantage when fighting these odds.
							</p>

							<p>
								Men were falling away from her on every side. Karris flung little ballsof fire at the
								tents nearest her, blocking her view, curse being short! Wherewas the man shouting
								orders? The tents went up in flames, but it didn’tseem to faze anyone but Karris.
								Everyone was fleeing.
							</p>

							<p>
								She was just beginning to get a sense of how many men were in thiscamp—there were dozens
								of tents, maybe a hundred men? Orholam, shehad to get out! Then she heard a thunderous
								roar. The ground around herfeet jumped into the air as musket balls struck and the
								concussion of theirfire rolled over her.
							</p>

							<p>
								She looked up and saw a wide half-circle of musketeers, at least forty ofthem. Half were
								reloading in smooth, practiced motions. Unhurried. Welltrained. The other half had their
								muskets, still loaded, trained on Karris.“The next volley takes your life, Karris White
								Oak!” a man shouted. Hewas lean, mounted, wearing rich garments that announced he was
								KingRask Garadul, if the smug expression on his face hadn’t. “The sword andthe luxin.
								Now,” he said.
							</p>

							<p>
								Karris looked at the semicircle of blasted dirt in front of her, trying togauge the
								accuracy of the king’s musketeers. Pretty damn good. They wereonly twenty paces away. It
								would take a miracle. King Garadul’s armorwas, of course, mirrored, and he had Mirrormen
								and drafters to his left andright. What about Corvan?
							</p>

							<p>
								If Corvan ran as fast as she had, he might get here at any time—Karrisalways lost track
								of time once fighting started. Maybe he’d already seenwhat she had gotten into. Either
								way, not even he could do anything againstthese odds. He certainly couldn’t save Karris
								from twenty musketeers withan easy shot at her.
							</p>

							<p>
								Karris pulled off her eye caps and dropped them and threw her swordaway and let the
								green and red dribble from her fingertips. Usually, whenshe let the luxin go, she felt
								less wild, less angry. Not this time.“Galan?” King Garadul said, gesturing to someone
								behind her.Karris was starting to turn when something heavy cracked her over thehead.
							</p>

							<p>
								Chapter 43
							</p>

							<p>
								Kip followed Commander Ironfist up another flight of steps, whichdisgorged them in front
								of the biggest double doors Kip had ever seen. Thedoors were a slightly smoky glass
								filled with slow waves of every hue, agreat lake of color.
							</p>

							<p>
								Commander Ironfist lifted one great silver knocker and pounded it ontothe door three
								times. It was as if he’d thrown three rocks into a pond oflight. Though the door itself
								didn’t move, the light within it cratered andthrew ripples out in every direction. It
								took Kip’s breath away. He put ahand on the door, and where his fingers touched, tiny
								ripples formed.“Don’t touch,” Ironfist barked.Kip pulled back his hand as if
								burned.“There are a few things you need to know before you go in, Kip,”
							</p>

							<p>
								Ironfist said. “First, it’s all real. We lose one out of every ten supplicants.”“Lose as
								in…”“They die. Second, you can make it stop whenever you want. There willbe a rope put
								in your hand. Pull the rope, and it will ring a bell. They’ll stopimmediately. Third, if
								you quit, you’re finished, you can’t stay. It costs a lotof money for a satrap to
								maintain a drafter, and not one of them will wastemoney on a coward. Gavin has
								instructed me that should you fail, I’m togive you enough silver to buy a small farm and
								put you on a ship to thedestination of your choice. It’s better than most failures get,
								but you’ll notbe allowed to return here ever again. You’re a shame enough as it is.”
							</p>

							<p>
								Apparently tact wasn’t part of the test. “I’m shameful?” Kip asked, alump rising in his
								throat. Gavin hadn’t treated him like that.
							</p>

							<p>
								Ironfist blinked. “The life of a drafter is hard and short. I don’t havetime for lies,
								no matter how comforting. You’re a bastard. That’s a commonenough shame for a great man,
								but it’s a shame nonetheless. Anyone whocan do simple arithmetic will know that you were
								sired while the Prism wasbetrothed to Karris White Oak, a woman most of us hold in high
								regard.Prisms are held to a higher standard, so you’re a greater shame than usual.Even
								if you’re excellent in every regard, you’ll be a shame. If you’re afailure, it’s worse.
								That’s the truth. Dressing it up in silk and lace isn’t goingto change it.“Now, fourth,
								they say Orholam himself watches every initiation.
							</p>

							<p>
								Failing means failing him, farmboy. Ready?
							</p>

							<p>
								If Kip failed, he’d be put off the island. Not only would he shame theman who’d saved
								his life, but he would lose his only chance for retributionon the man who’d taken his
								mother’s.
							</p>

							<p>
								Kip wasn’t going to fail. He’d die first.Ironfist saw the look on his face. “Good.”The
								great doors in front of Kip rippled once more, the molten iridescenthues undulating
								gently and then seeming to spill left and right. It was as ifsomething huge were
								surfacing from unimaginable depths. Kip’s heartseized as a great face appeared, so fast
								he couldn’t even comprehend all thedetails, just white hair, eyes like stars, and water
								of every shade burstingaway from his features as he burst free—and opened his mouth, a
								yawningcavern of blackness that overwhelmed the doors. Kip flinched as it seemedthe
								mouth would swallow him.
							</p>

							<p>
								The doors burst open from within as if a giant had smashed them. A gustof air rushed
								over Kip.“Enter,” Ironfist commanded.Kip walked in alone to a round chamber. The walls
								and floor were thesame smoky-clear crystal as the door. Seven figures stood in a
								crescentaround a black disk inlaid in the floor. Kip hesitated, and none of themmoved.
								No one told him where to go.
							</p>

							<p>
								The figures were robed, one for each color. The superviolet wore violetrobes and sub-red
								wore deep red robes for the benefit of those who couldn’tsee into their spectra, but as
								Kip widened and then tightened his eyes, hesaw that the sub-red was indeed radiating
								heat and the superviolet was cladin his color, hard pieces of superviolet luxin hooked
								together like rings ofmail.
							</p>

							<p>
								Still uncertain, Kip walked toward them. As he got closer, he could seebeneath their
								hoods. His fists balled. The sub-red had blackened skin. Noeyebrows. No hair. Little
								flame wisps escaped from its head. The green’sface was gnarled as an old oak, its
								eyebrows like moss, hair strung withlichen. The blue looked like cut glass, features
								either smoothed out toplanes or sharpened to jewel-like points.
							</p>

							<p>
								Dear Orholam, were these all color wights? Then, from within his sleekgoo, the orange
								blinked. Kip noticed the eyes. All of their eyes.
							</p>

							<p>
								These were drafters in masks and makeup. They represented the wightsof each color. Seven
								different varieties of death and dishonor. Kip startedbreathing again, though he
								couldn’t control a little tremble. He stepped ontothe black disk facing them.“I am Anat,
								I am wrath,” the sub-red said. “I am consumed with rage.”“I am Dagnu, I am gluttony,”
								the red said. “I can never be filled.”“I am Molokh, I am greed,” the orange said. “I can
								never be satisfied.”“I am Belphegor, I am sloth,” the yellow said. “I withhold my
								talents.”“I am Atirat, I am lust,” the green said. “I desire ever more.”“I am Mot, I am
								envy,” the blue said. “I cannot bear others’ goodfortune.”“I am Ferrilux, I am pride,”
								the superviolet said. “I would usurp
							</p>

							<p>
								Orholam’s own throne.”
							</p>

							<p>
								They were the names of the old gods. Kip had barely even heard ofthem.“These are the
								distortions of our nature.”“The temptations of power.” The voices spoke out in turn,
								smoothly,overlapping, like one consciousness.“For without mastery of ourselves, we
								become monsters.”“Shameful and ashamed, hiding in the darkness.”“But we are the sons and
								daughters of Orholam.”“We are Orholam’s gift, expressions of his love.”“His law.”“His
								mercy.”“His truth.”“Thus we stand unashamed, clothed in his righteousness.”The sub-red
								stepped forward, pulled off his mask, and stepped out of hisrobe. He was a young man,
								muscular, handsome, and naked. “Casting offwrath, I am patience,” the sub-red said. He
								lifted his hands and, evenwithout looking into the sub-red, it was clear that he was
								drafting. The airshimmered with heat around his whole body. “Orholam’s will be done.”
							</p>

							<p>
								The red stepped forward, pulled off her mask, and stepped out of herrobe. She was young,
								athletic, beautiful, and also naked. Kip’s eyeswidened. He tried to hold them to her
								face.
							</p>

							<p>
								Somber ceremony, Kip. Orholam’s watching, Kip. Straight to hell, Kip.“Casting off
								gluttony, I am temperance,” the red said. She lifted herhands and red luxin blossomed
								through her entire body, eyes, face, downher neck to her breasts, nipples, firm tight
								stomach, breasts, nipples—Kip!In an instant, she was like a statue, every bit of her
								skin dyed a perfect red.“Orholam’s will be done,” she said.
							</p>

							<p>
								The orange stepped forward. A man, mercifully. “Casting off greed, Iam charity,” he
								said. Lifting his hands, he turned a gleaming orange.“Orholam’s will be done.”
							</p>

							<p>
								Yellow said, “Casting off sloth, I am diligence. Orholam’s will be done.”
							</p>

							<p>
								Her body filled with sparkling yellow light.
							</p>

							<p>
								The green was a disconcertingly if appropriately curvaceous womanwho looked Kip hard in
								the eye. That helped as she disrobed. He thoughtshe might slap his head off if he looked
								at her generous—oops. “Casting offlust, I am self-control,” she said. “Orholam’s will be
								done.”
							</p>

							<p>
								The blue disrobed. “Casting off envy, I am kindness,” she said softly.“Orholam’s will be
								done.”
							</p>

							<p>
								The superviolet was the last man, and he was enormously muscular.“Casting off pride, I
								am humility,” he said in a booming voice. “Orholam’swill be done.”
							</p>

							<p>
								As one, they brought their hands down and pointed them at Kip’s feet.
							</p>

							<p>
								Sprays of pure color blasted the black circle he stood on. It began to rumbleand rattle
								beneath his feet. Then, abruptly, the disk of rock began sinkinginto the floor—and Kip
								with it.
							</p>

							<p>
								In moments, Kip was down to his butt. But the hole was too narrow. Hisfat caught on the
								sharp sides of the floor. He had to shimmy just to fit, andas the hole deepened, either
								his stomach or his butt was pressing against awall.“Raise your right hand,” the
								superviolet said.As Kip did, swallowing convulsively, he saw a rope dropping all theway
								from a ceiling so high above that he couldn’t see past the glare of itsbrightness. The
								superviolet caught the rope and put the knotted end in Kip’supraised hand.“Pull the
								rope, and it ends,” the man said. He had something akin tokindness in his voice.
							</p>

							<p>
								Then Kip was fully in the hole, and still going down. He stopped belowthe floor. The
								light high above in the testing chamber went out. Kip couldsee nothing.
							</p>

							<p>
								He tried to take a deep breath, but the chamber was so tight he couldn’teven draw a full
								breath.
							</p>

							<p>
								There were whispered voices above him. “Dees, will you run this testfor me?”
							</p>

							<p>
								A man’s voice replied, awkward, “I’ve never run one before, my lord.
							</p>

							<p>
								You know, I think we set the tube too narrow. He’s fat. He could suffocate.”“He’s the
								Prism’s bastard.”“So? He’s not here.”“So accidents happen. But I can’t be here when they
								do. The Prismknows I hate him. He doesn’t know you. So if an accident happens on
								yourwatch—”
							</p>

							<p>
								Kip couldn’t hear the rest because water started pouring over his head.
							</p>

							<p>
								Cold, first a dribble, then a steady stream. It ran down the back of his neckto where
								his back was pressed tight against the walls. The walls around himpulsed an intense
								blue. Dear Orholam, they were going to kill him to getback at his father. Just like
								Gavin had warned him.
							</p>

							<p>
								The water pooled around his middle. He was too fat for it to drain downto his feet, he
								sealed the whole tube. Kip’s heart was pounding. The intenselight emanating through the
								walls burned from blue down into green,through the whole spectrum in order, even through
								heat, and then faded intonothing again as the water reached Kip’s neck.
							</p>

							<p>
								Up to his ear. He pushed his body hard against the side of the chamber,and a gap opened
								between his hip and the wall. The pooled water poureddown to his feet. But it kept
								coming from above.
							</p>

							<p>
								For a few moments, he was able to intermittently push against the walland make it drain
								once more, but soon he was awash, nearly floating. Hepushed against the wall again, and
								the water didn’t drain at all. There wasnowhere for it go.
							</p>

							<p>
								The water rose once more to his left shoulder, which was trapped downeven as his right
								was trapped up. Then up to his neck. His left ear.
							</p>

							<p>
								He didn’t notice when the walls pulsed superviolet, but then they passedthrough blue, to
								green as the water rose to his chin, to yellow as it touchedhis lips, orange as it
								covered his lips—was the water falling more slowly onhis head now? He took deep breaths
								through his nose, wriggled to try to usehis body’s wedged-in position to climb higher in
								the tube, and found thatthere were straps above his shoulders, keeping him down.
							</p>

							<p>
								This was insanity. Someone was trying to kill him. Kip had to ring thebell. His fingers
								were claws around the rope. He could try again when therewasn’t a murderer around.
							</p>

							<p>
								No. Quitting meant being put out. It meant failing.There was barely time to take one
								last deep breath before the watercovered Kip’s nose.
							</p>

							<p>
								The falling water pelting his head abruptly ceased. Kip could imagine itnow: “He was so
								fat, he trapped the water. It wasn’t supposed to be thathigh. We didn’t put too much
								water in… he just panicked. You know, achild, trapped and afraid. He must not have even
								thought to pull the rope.”
							</p>

							<p>
								So that was it. He either quit and shamed his father more than his veryexistence already
								did, or his father’s enemies did their best to kill him.
							</p>

							<p>
								Holding his breath, his lungs just beginning to burn, there was a sudden,stark clarity
								to the world: pull the rope, go home.
							</p>

							<p>
								But, there was no home. So, pull the rope, and go farm… somewhere.
							</p>

							<p>
								Or stay, and maybe die. Fail here, and he failed his father and his mother.Fail here,
								and he was a failure forever.
							</p>

							<p>
								I’m not pulling the rope.The chamber went black. The water got hot from the sub-red
								light, butthen even that faded.
							</p>

							<p>
								I don’t like farming. Kip coughed out some of his air, laughing, thethought was so
								inane. But the pain rapidly squelched wry humor. Hecouldn’t make his heart slow. He
								couldn’t stop his throat from swallowingconvulsively, his chest from pumping on nothing.
								I’m not pulling the rope,damn you. I’m not pulling the rope.
							</p>

							<p>
								Something shifted. At first, Kip thought it was the water pouring out,but it wasn’t. The
								ground below him was rising, but the stops above hisshoulders stayed in place, crushing
								him in place. The water, far fromdraining, simply rose up his raised arm. In moments, he
								squatted down,pushed against his own knees. It squeezed him and he coughed, the last
								ofhis breath bubbling out.
							</p>

							<p>
								He was trying to hold on to nothing. Breathing the water in would beworse than breathing
								nothing at all, he knew it. He knew it and yet his bodyoverwhelmed him and he sucked a
								breath in. The water was hot, sharp,acrid in his lungs. He gagged, hunched even tighter
								against his own knees,his body ripping itself apart. He coughed and, miraculously, water
								shot outof his mouth into air, blessed, glorious, free, beautiful air!
							</p>

							<p>
								Gasping, spitting, retching, and still compressed into a ball, Kipbreathed. He could
								breathe! Mostly. His knees hurt from being squashedtighter than his not-so-flexible
								joints would allow. His back hurt. His ribshurt. But Orholam, the air was good. If only
								he could get a full breath.
							</p>

							<p>
								Nothing happened. It was still utterly black. Kip was sweating now. Hewas packed in
								here. It was getting hotter by the second and he was stilldripping wet. The colors
								flashed past him, through the whole spectrumagain.
							</p>

							<p>
								So that’s how it was. They saw that he wasn’t going to quit, so theyweren’t going to
								give him another chance with the colors.
							</p>

							<p>
								It didn’t matter. I’m not pulling the rope. “I’m not pulling the rope!” Kipshouted. Or
								tried to shout; he wasn’t very loud with only a half a breath.
							</p>

							<p>
								In response, the floor rose even more, crushing him harder against thestays on his
								shoulders. Kip screamed. He sounded like a coward.
							</p>

							<p>
								He couldn’t even push back against the stays. His knees were bent toofar to get him any
								leverage. If he just pulled on the rope a little, he could geta breath, and then he
								could go on fighting.
							</p>

							<p>
								No! Kip deliberately relaxed his fingers, his arm. He concentrated onbreathing. Tiny,
								quick little breaths.
							</p>

							<p>
								It was enough. It would be enough. He was making it enough.A succession of colors
								blurred past. Kip didn’t care. Was he supposed todo something? What? Draft? Right. Go
								bugger yourselves.
							</p>

							<p>
								The pressure eased suddenly and the floor dropped. Then the wallseased wider. Kip almost
								fell, but after a moment his rubbery legs were ableto take his weight. The walls pulled
								back farther, farther. He tried to take awider stance, but there was nothing beyond his
								little disk except air.
							</p>

							<p>
								Reaching one hand out, Kip couldn’t feel the walls at all. A breeze blewacross his skin,
								giving him the sensation that he was standing on some highplace. It had to be an
								illusion, though, he was in the middle of the school.No way was there a big hole here.
							</p>

							<p>
								Colors flashed through distant walls, illuminating the chamber for abrief, terrifying
								moment. Kip stood over an abyss. His disk was the tinyround top of a pillar: a pillar
								standing alone in the middle of nothingness.The walls were thirty paces away. The
								ceiling over his head had a singlehole, through which only his hand was poking.
							</p>

							<p>
								Wind buffeted him, and Kip felt his grip go white-knuckled on the rope.
							</p>

							<p>
								He clamped his eyes shut, but then he couldn’t tell if he was swaying withthe wind or
								against it or staying still. His heart was beating so hard he couldhear his own pulse in
								his ears between gasping breaths. He screamed words,but he didn’t even know what they
								were.
							</p>

							<p>
								After an eternity, the walls came back. They closed firmly around him,but comfortably
								now, and he felt a surge of relief. He’d made it. He’dpassed. He hadn’t given up. He’d
								hadn’t pulled the—Something touched hisleg.
							</p>

							<p>
								What was that?It curled around his ankle, twisted around his calf. A snake. Kip lookedup
								and some many-legged thing dropped on his face.
							</p>

							<p>
								He reached a spastic hand up to sweep a spider away, but felt a manaclesnap over his
								wrist and pull his left arm away, lock it into place. He tried tokick the snake away
								from his feet. Snap, snap. Shackles closed around hisfeet and yanked them wide apart.
							</p>

							<p>
								Kip screamed.The spider fell into his mouth.Before he even knew what he was doing, Kip
								bit down fiercely on it,crushing it in his teeth, sour goo squirting into his mouth. He
								screamedagain, sheer defiance. Something landed in his hair. Dozens of slitheringthings
								roped around his feet, climbed his legs. He was going crazy.“I’m not pulling the rope!”
								he shouted. “You bastards, I’m not pullingthe rope!”
							</p>

							<p>
								Kip convulsed. Orholam have mercy. His whole body was covered withloathsome things. He
								was weeping, screaming—and salvation lay in hishand. There was nothing wrong with
								farming. No one would hold failureagainst him. He didn’t need to see these people ever
								again. And what did hecare what they thought of him anyway? The whole game was
								stackedagainst him. He was finished. It was over.
							</p>

							<p>
								With an inhuman cry, Kip took the rope, with all his loathing and furyand despair rising
								in him, totally overwhelming him, failure calling hisname—and threw it out of the hole.
								He sank against the wall, burying hisface in the rock, crying.
							</p>

							<p>
								Colors flashed past once more, but the snakes and spiders didn’t go.
							</p>

							<p>
								They covered his body.
							</p>

							<p>
								Still the oppressive darkness continued. Something heavy and hairylanded on his back.
								Little claws stabbed him through his shirt. A rat. Thenone on his thigh. Another landed
								on his head, scratching him as it slid offhis wet hair.
							</p>

							<p>
								Kip froze. Fear like lightning flashed through his entire body. He was ina cupboard,
								helpless, starving, parched. He shivered uncontrollably.
							</p>

							<p>
								His motion disrupted the nasties and something bit him. He yelped,humiliated, furious.
								He twisted. More prickly bites, stinging bites, savagebites covered his arm, his legs,
								his groin, his back. Kip thrashed, throwinghimself against one wall and then the other,
								trying to crush the beasts. Ratswere climbing up his body on every side, and they
								refused to let go. He wasweeping. He was so ashamed. There was something about the
								spider. Thespider he’d bitten.
							</p>

							<p>
								It was too much. He couldn’t take it anymore. He was finished. Kipcouldn’t stop himself.
								He reached for the rope. He was a failure, a shame, afat, blubbering coward. A nothing.
							</p>

							<p>
								He felt the rope pressed back into his hand. “Here you go, Tubby,” asatisfied voice
								whispered. The taste, Kip. The taste was wrong, a kind voicesaid.
							</p>

							<p>
								What the woman had said didn’t quite register. They were all over him.Kip pulled the
								rope. Failure.A distant clang, high overhead. At once, the stinging ceased.
								Everyslithering, crawling, clinging, stinging thing evaporated, disappeared. Theyweren’t
								real. They hadn’t been real rats. Kip should have known from thespider he’d bitten.
								Would have known, if he hadn’t been such a coward.That goo inside hadn’t been guts, it
								had been luxin. It was all illusions, fakefears. He’d been tricked.
							</p>

							<p>
								He’d failed. As the platform rose, Kip’s brain—no longer fogged withterror—realized what
								the woman had called him: “Tubby.” It was whatRam used to call him. Kip died a little.
								He’d proved Ram right. Again.
							</p>

							<p>
								As he emerged, though, the men and women were now dressed infestive robes of their own
								colors, dazzling sapphire blues, emerald greens,diamond yellows, ruby reds. They
								appeared jubilant.“Congratulations, supplicant!” Mistress Varidos said, coming to join
								thecircle.
							</p>

							<p>
								Kip stared at her, dumbfounded.“Four minutes and twelve seconds. You should be very
								proud. I’m sureyour father will be.”
							</p>

							<p>
								She was speaking some language Kip didn’t understand. Proud? He’dfailed. He’d shamed
								himself, shamed his father. He’d given up. The rageand frustration that had been
								building up suddenly had nowhere to go,leaving him feeling stupid.“I failed,” Kip
								said.“Everybody fails!” the incredibly muscular superviolet said. “You didgreat! Four
								minutes twelve! I only lasted a minute six.”“I don’t understand,” Kip said.The nymphish
								yellow laughed. “That’s how the test is designed. We allfailed.”
							</p>

							<p>
								They surrounded him, men pounding him on the back, women touchinghis arms or shoulder,
								all congratulating him. It was a bit intoxicating to beso wholeheartedly welcomed by
								people who were so beautiful. Now thathis brain was working again, he noticed that they
								hadn’t necessarily chosenmen to represent the old gods and women for the goddesses. Was
								thatbecause they’d come so far that it simply didn’t matter anymore, or was itdeliberate
								disrespect?“Is it true?” Kip asked Mistress Varidos, who had stood back some lestthe
								jostling crowd knock her over. “Everyone fails?”
							</p>

							<p>
								She smiled. “Almost everyone. It’s not to see if you can make it throughthe test, it’s
								to see what kind of a person you are. And fear widens youreyes. Those colors you saw
								flashing past were the real test. Those will tellus what you can draft. Are you ready to
								see your results?”“Wait. ‘Almost everyone’? Who doesn’t fail?” Kip asked.The jubilant
								men and women quieted.The old woman said, “The only person in my lifetime who didn’t
								takethe rope was…”
							</p>

							<p>
								Gavin. Kip knew it. Of course. His father had been the one man who didwhat no one else
								could do, what no one else had ever done. Kip had failedhim.“Your uncle,” the mistress
								said.My “uncle” Gavin, or my uncle Dazen?
							</p>

							<p>
								Apparently registering his confusion, she said, “Your uncle Dazen Guile,who nearly
								destroyed our world. Good footsteps not to follow, hm?”
							</p>

							<p>
								She was speaking that other language again. After all Kip had seen
							</p>

							<p>
								Gavin do, it was Gavin’s brother who’d passed?“Four minutes is wonderful, Kip, but
								that’s just bragging rights. Are youready to see your colors?”
							</p>

							<p>
								Chapter 44
							</p>

							<p>
								Liv dropped into a curtsey, glad for the excuse to break eye contact with thePrism. When
								she straightened, Gavin Guile was looking at her critically.Obviously she’d been right,
								not many women answered his summonses intheir work clothes and no cosmetics.“It’s been a
								long time since I’ve seen a proper Tyrean curtsey,” the
							</p>

							<p>
								Prism said.
							</p>

							<p>
								After your armies left, there weren’t many women left to curtsey. “Howmay I serve you,
								High Luxlord Prism?” Liv asked instead.“Lord Prism is sufficient,” Gavin said.“Thank
								you, Lord Prism.”He was obviously weighing her, thinking. But thinking what?
								Whateverelse that wretched woman Aglaia Crassos had done, she’d made Liv thinkof the
								Prism as Gavin Guile—a man, and a good-looking one at that. Hiseyes were—quite
								literally—the most entrancing eyes in the entire world.
							</p>

							<p>
								Magister, Liv. Tutor. Lord. Luxlord. Noble. General. Twice as old asyou. Way too old for
								you. Not a broad-shouldered, muscular man—justanother magister. You can go to hell,
								Aglaia Crassos.“Have you chosen who you want to be your magister in yellow?” heasked.
							</p>

							<p>
								Thank you!See, I’m a disciple. Purely academic. A child in comparison to him.
							</p>

							<p>
								Hopelessly young and ignorant. She pursed her lips. “Honestly, I’d like tostudy under
								Mistress Tawenza Goldeneyes.” She could barely believe she’ddared say it out loud. The
								woman only took three disciples a year—and shealready had three. The three best yellow
								disciples in the Chromeria.
							</p>

							<p>
								Gavin laughed. “That prickly she-bear? A bold choice. She’s the best,and she probably
								won’t hate you as much as you think she does for the firstyear. I’d have you send my
								compliments to her when I assign her a fourthstudent, but she’d doubtless take it out on
								you. Consider it done. How areyour apartments?”
							</p>

							<p>
								She paused. It was almost a personal question. No, he’s simply worried—no, not worried,
								he’s checking that his orders have been carried out.Generals do that sort of thing.
								“They’re better than anything I thought I’dever have, Lord Prism. And the clothes? I
								used to have three dresses. NowI’ve got more than fifty and my worst is nicer than my
								old Sun Day best.”Wait, maybe clothes weren’t the best topic.“And yet you decided to
								come in this,” Gavin said, noticing. Oops. Hisvoice didn’t intone disapproval. If
								anything, there was a thin thread ofamusement. But his face didn’t give her any
								expression to know if he wasirritated. She should have listened to that slave, Marissia.
								It wouldn’t havekilled her to freshen up a little. He glanced past her, and she followed
								hisgaze, but the room was empty except for the two of them, and there were nounusual
								decorations on the walls, just the normal testing crystal.“You said to come at my
								earliest convenience.” She couldn’t keep adefensive tone out of her voice. “I thought
								you’d not want to be keptwaiting.” That was better. Nicely assertive, Liv.“I think
								you’ll do perfectly.”“Lord Prism?”“You’re perfect because you refuse to be impressed,
								Aliviana. I like that.
							</p>

							<p>
								It—”“I wouldn’t exactly say I’m not impressed!”He grinned. “You say, interrupting
								me.”And proving his point.Liv decided to shut up. Maybe differentiating herself from all
								the otherwomen who came here—and were unsuccessful in their attempts to seduceGavin—had
								not been a good plan.“It seems every time I summon a woman between the ages of
								thirteenand sixty, she comes dressed like a Ruthgari courtesan, either overly eageror
								completely terrified. Like I run a brothel up here.”
							</p>

							<p>
								Oh, Orholam strike me, what if I’ve done the one thing that makes memore attractive to
								him? “You’re Gavin Guile,” Liv said, like that explainedeverything. It did. Not only
								would snaring the Prism totally change awoman’s own life, but it would change her entire
								family’s life. Immediatelyand for generations to come, and for the better. Add gorgeous
								and virile to“Prism,” which already meant powerful, respected, and rich, and Liv had
								nodoubt that hemlines soared and necklines swooped. It was a wonder thatwomen didn’t
								come to the Prism naked. How much would Ana have wornif the Prism had summoned her?
							</p>

							<p>
								On second thought, Liv didn’t want to think about that.“Yes, I am,” Gavin said, smirking
								as if at some private joke. “And I needyour help, Aliviana.”
							</p>

							<p>
								Liv swallowed. The truth was, he could ask anything, and there was noway she could say
								no. “Liv, please.”“Right.” Gavin cleared his throat. Why is he clearing his throat?
								Hefeels awkward? Does he feel awkward starting an affair with a girl half hisage?
							</p>

							<p>
								Gavin glanced over Liv’s shoulder again. “A number of years ago—itfeels like quite a
								number of years ago… I have a… nephew. His mother wasTyrean. I want you to tutor him. It
								might make him feel more comfortableto learn from another Tyrean. I know you Tyreans
								don’t have it easy here.What do you say?”
							</p>

							<p>
								Liv spluttered. A “nephew”? A tutor? Kip! Of course! Orholam, she’dgone completely the
								wrong direction! Idiot! The Prism hadn’t even beenthinking anything remotely…“W-well, of
								course, Lord Prism. Is there…why do…” What was she saying? She’d already been
								impertinent enough.Asking the wrong question about a man’s bastard might be a good way
								toruin everything. “What color is he gifted with?” She only remembered atthe last second
								to say “he” and not “Kip.” She wasn’t supposed to knowKip was the Prism’s bastard at
								all.
							</p>

							<p>
								I would make a lousy spy.“Green. Possibly blue. He’s being initiated right now.”“Right
								now?” Liv asked. The year’s initiations had been completed longago. Liv had never heard
								of someone being initiated at any other time ofyear. “How long has your—how long has he
								been here?”“He arrived yesterday.”“And he’s being initiated already?!” Liv asked. Poor
								Kip.Gavin glanced behind her again. This time, she knew what he waslooking at.
								Throughout the tower, for reasons Liv had never comprehended,there were plain crystals
								set into the walls. For the whole year, they simplysat and sparkled, dully refracting
								whatever light they caught from theirsurroundings, but during initiations at the
								beginning of each year, theyglowed brilliantly. As the supplicants passed through the
								Thresher,invariably there was the wash of one color after another as each
								testprogressed, the same wash each supplicant saw. As soon as they drafted, thecrystal
								turned a brilliant hue in whatever color they drafted. For Liv it hadbeen superviolet
								first, then yellow weakly.
							</p>

							<p>
								The whole time Liv had been here, the Prism had been watching to seehow his bastard son
								was doing.
							</p>

							<p>
								Come to think of it, if the test had been going on since the first time
							</p>

							<p>
								Gavin Guile had glanced behind Liv, it was taking a really long time.Usually it took
								less than a minute.
							</p>

							<p>
								They both turned to look at the crystal. “What did the tester say whenthey lowered you
								into the Thresher?” Gavin asked.“He said something about the only good rebel being a
								dead rebel, andhow he still owed my father blood,” Liv said. The point had been, as
								italways was, to scare the person being tested. Fear made the eyes dilate.Fear made a
								supplicant draft to the utmost of her abilities. It also helpedeven the most arrogant
								young lady or lordling begin their studies with a bitof humility.“How about you?” Liv
								asked. Neither of them turned from the crystal.“Something about my brother,” Gavin said.
								“Turned out to be more rightthan they knew.”“I’m sorry,” Liv said. She wasn’t sure if
								she was apologizing for asking,for the tester, or for the real-life nightmare Gavin had
								gone through later inhaving to kill his own brother.“I never liked that part, scaring
								them. The chamber is terrifying enough,and the thought of failing is scary enough. They
								don’t have to makesupplicants think they’re really going to die. It breaks people. It
								breakschildren.”
							</p>

							<p>
								Liv had never thought about it that way. The Thresher just was.
							</p>

							<p>
								Everyone went through it. It was inextricable from drafting, from theChromeria. If
								nothing else, every drafter had the Thresher in common.“The noble girls all knew what
								was coming,” Liv said. “Unlike the restof us. They knew the test itself wouldn’t hurt
								them, so that bit of talkingoutside the test was the only thing that made them afraid.
								Because even ifthey’d been warned, hearing a tester who claims to belong to your
								enemy’sfamily say that accidents happen is terrifying.”“Hadn’t thought of that,” Gavin
								said. “All my friends were nobles. Ithought everyone knew what was coming.”
							</p>

							<p>
								Of course you did. It’s just another way the Chromeria’s stacked to favoryour kind.
							</p>

							<p>
								Gavin cleared his throat. “Liv, my son might be special, really gifted.
							</p>

							<p>
								We’ll find out presently, but I wouldn’t be surprised if he’s a polychrome.He’s Tyrean,
								his mother just died, he’s going to face false friends andunearned enemies just for
								being my son; he won’t fit in anywhere and yetpeople are going to be watching him all
								the time. If he’s truly powerful ontop of that… he could turn into a monster. He
								wouldn’t be the first in myfamily to handle great power poorly. The gift isn’t a pure
								gift, you know.”“What do you want me to do?” Liv asked. Was she really going to
								betutoring the Prism’s son? Bastard son, but still. She felt like a huge weighthad been
								lifted off of her. The Prism was just the Prism—well, maybe therewas no such thing as
								being just the most powerful man in the world—but hewas a lord to whom she owed service.
								Normal service. Something notterribly hard, given how completely he’d changed her
								life.“Maybe he’ll be a monochrome. Probably will be. I’m getting ahead ofmyself,” Gavin
								said.“But if he’s not?” You’ve got to let me know what your expectations areor I’m going
								to fail—and then you’ll be mad at me for that. Typicalnobleman. Liv felt good that she
								was able to be irritated. She was regainingher bearings.“Pretend he’s normal. In all
								ways. I know he’d figure it out prettyquickly if we stay, but I’m going to take him away
								from here as soon as Ipossibly can. Until then, give him some normalcy. If he makes you
								mad,yell at him. Smack his knuckles with a stick if he misbehaves, youunderstand? But if
								he masters something difficult, pretend it’s good butnothing out of the norm. I want him
								to know that those who matter aren’tgoing to be impressed by who his father is or how
								much he can draft.”“And who are these people?” Liv asked sarcastically. She hadn’t
								reallymeant to say it out loud, but Gavin was being ridiculously idealistic. Ofcourse
								who he was and how much he could draft mattered. Maybe whenyou were born on the top of
								the mountain you could pretend the mountaindidn’t matter, but those who climbed it and
								those born at its base who couldnever climb at all knew differently.“Me and Orholam,”
								Gavin said, ignoring her tone. “If we’re the onlyones whose approval he cares about,
								he’s got a chance.”
							</p>

							<p>
								Liv didn’t know if that was the most arrogant or the most profound thingshe’d ever
								heard. Maybe both. Whatever else it did, though, it reminded herwho and what Gavin was.
								By Orholam’s scowling brow, she’d been gliblysarcastic to the Prism, the man closest in
								all the world to Orholam himself.And thank Orholam that Liv had turned down that awful
								woman. Even if itwas going to cost her dearly. Spying on the Prism himself? It
								waspractically sacrilegious. As bad as Liv’s stupidity and awkwardness andhorrifying
								sliver of infatuation was, how awful would it have been to be atraitor too? She
								swallowed. “I’m sorry, Lord Prism, I was out of—”
							</p>

							<p>
								Gavin raised a hand and stood abruptly.Liv glanced at the crystal but saw nothing. The
								crystal hadn’t changed.
							</p>

							<p>
								She looked over at Gavin in time to see the Prism blanch—then his facewas lit up like
								the sun had just come out from behind the blackest clouds.
							</p>

							<p>
								A wash of colors flashed through his skin and he threw out a handtoward the crystal. A
								crackling, shimmering tube of luxin shot from hishand and stuck to the crystal on the
								opposite wall like an iridescentspiderweb on fire. More and more gushed out of the man,
								pushing deep intothe crystal.
							</p>

							<p>
								And then, as abruptly as he started, Gavin stopped. A moment later, thecrystal glowed a
								brilliant jade green, and then a less intense blue.
							</p>

							<p>
								Gavin sighed with relief.“What was that?” Liv asked.“A secret!” Gavin barked. He
								gestured, and Liv felt a gust of cold windand heard the windows drop heavily into their
								slots.“Come here,” the Prism ordered. His body filled with every color in therainbow and
								beyond. A rope of green luxin wrapped around a chain ofyellow-infused blue ran from his
								hand. “Now, girl! I have to be there first tocontain this, and he’s going to need you.”
							</p>

							<p>
								In a daze, Liv hurried over to the Prism. She didn’t even know what hewas talking
								about.“Get on my back,” he said.“What?”“On my back, now! Hold on tight.”
							</p>

							<p>
								She jumped on his back. His body was unnaturally hot from the sub-redshe was holding
								along with every other color. What was he doing? Shelooked at the chain he was holding
								again. Then he turned and faced the voidoutside his window. She squeaked and held on
								with a death grip.“Nna tha igh!” the Prism said.“What?” Liv asked, loosening her grip
								around his neck.“Not that tight,” he growled.Even as she apologized, bands of luxin
								whipped around her body,holding her tight against him. Gavin took a run toward the
								window andleapt.
							</p>

							<p>
								Liv’s view, at first, was only of the luxin spooling out of Gavin’s handlike spider’s
								silk, perfectly matching the rate at which they were falling. Sherealized she had no
								idea how far exactly they would have to fall to get tothe level of the Threshing
								Chamber, or how Gavin would know when tostop them. For that matter, how did he mean to
								get back into the tower fromthe outside? Hope someone left a window open?
							</p>

							<p>
								Oh, dear Orholam!They were falling an awfully long time. Liv’s eyes disobeyed her
								andjumped from the luxin above to the ground below. It was rushing up at themwith
								incredible speed.
							</p>

							<p>
								Then she was crushed into Gavin’s back as he solidified the rope. Thepressure threatened
								to sweep her off of him and straight into the courtyard.They whipped around backward and
								she saw the rope-chain spooled out tothe distant top of the Prism’s Tower, and the tower
								itself was loomingbigger and bigger as as they swung back toward its sheer, unbroken
								face.
							</p>

							<p>
								Three sharp jerks pushed her and Gavin backward, but with nowherenear enough force to
								slow them down. Briefly, Liv saw three missilesstreaking out from Gavin’s outstretched
								left hand toward the tower in frontof them.
							</p>

							<p>
								She didn’t see what the missiles did, because whatever else theyaccomplished, with Gavin
								shooting them out of his left hand while his rightheld the rope, he absorbed the recoil
								with his left arm. So as soon as themissiles were out of his hand, Gavin and Liv were
								sent spinning sharplywiddershins.
							</p>

							<p>
								Glass and stone exploded on every side around Liv. She was slidingalong a floor, zipping
								straight and smooth for a fraction of a second,abruptly cut away from the Prism. Then
								something caught the hem of herskirt. Her momentum and the friction with the floor
								yanked it up hard, andthen her bare skin squeaked on naked stone. She flopped over
								sideways androlled a few times. When she stopped against the wall, all she could
								thinkwas that she couldn’t believe she was still alive.
							</p>

							<p>
								There were half a dozen drafters in the suddenly breezy hallway, lookingat the Prism and
								her in disbelief. The Prism was already up, giving sharporders.
							</p>

							<p>
								Why is my butt cold? Liv followed the drafters’ stares and looked down.
							</p>

							<p>
								Her skirt was bunched around her waist from the slide, exposing her to allthe world. She
								squeaked, yanked her skirt down, and jumped to her feet.“You, get Luxlord Black. Tell
								him I want this repaired. Today. Goimmediately. You, take the names of everyone in this
								hall and everyone inthe testing chamber,” the Prism was saying. Liv, seeing everyone’s
								attentionwas on the Prism, shifted her hips. She hadn’t noticed until after she
								jumpedup, but her butt cheeks had been cold because her underclothes had beenyanked up
								too. Now they were cleaving the moon in a serious way. Sheshimmied, trying to fix her
								underclothes without fishing after them with ahand. “Aliviana, what are you doing?” the
								Prism asked.
							</p>

							<p>
								Liv froze, transfixed.“Never mind, stay here. I’ll call for you in a moment.” Gavin
								opened thedoor to the testing chamber and slipped inside. All the drafters in the
								hall,including one of the best-looking young magisters in the whole Chromeria,Payam
								Navid, turned to look at Liv, obviously wondering why she was soimportant—and killing
								her chance to quickly tug her underclothes down.Not having any idea what she was going
								to find or what the Prism wasgoing to expect of her, she smiled nervously at the young
								magister.
							</p>

							<p>
								Chapter 45
							</p>

							<p>
								Gavin moved quickly, hearing the old bichrome say, “Are you ready to seeyour colors?” to
								Kip.“I know I am!” Gavin said. “Mistress Varidos, may I?” Family membersof supplicants
								weren’t allowed in the testing chamber for fear that it wouldlead to cheating. The rule,
								at least theoretically, even applied to the Prism.There’s a reason theory and practice
								are two different words.“I wasn’t even aware that you’d begun your testing. How long did
								theysay you lasted?” Gavin asked.“Four minutes, I guess,” Kip said.“Four twelve,” the
								old mistress said.Gavin physically stopped. It had seemed like a long time up in his
								room,but he’d supposed it had only seemed long. Four minutes was astounding.Passing had
								only taken him five.
							</p>

							<p>
								Mistress Varidos drew close to Gavin and whispered, “There was someirregularity that I
								think you should know about.”
							</p>

							<p>
								Gavin smiled at Kip. “Well done, we’ll just be a moment.” He cameaside, leaving Kip with
								the men and women who were asking him whichpart he thought was hardest, how he’d managed
								to hold out so long, andgenerally treating him like the center of the world. It was
								pretty intoxicatingfor a young drafter, and it was supposed to be.
							</p>

							<p>
								Grinning, Gavin walked toward the tester’s table with Mistress Varidos.
							</p>

							<p>
								They came to stand right over the stone table. A black samite cloth wasspread over a
								hole in the middle of the table. The testing stone would beright in there. Gavin tried
								to remember exactly how it was positioned. He’donly get one shot at this. “What was the
								irregularity?” he asked. The samiteblocked out any outside light that would interfere
								with the testing stone.

							<p>
								The old woman exhaled slowly. “He threw the rope out of his hand atabout three thirty.
								Before I could stop her, one of the women put it back inhis hand.”“Are you joking?”
								Gavin said.“They send the beautiful ones for the testing. Half of them barely havethe
								brains to remember their lines, much less remember some of the moreobscure rules
								governing situations that have never arisen in living memory.Even Dazen didn’t throw the
								rope aside.”“Which one did it?”“The green.”Of course it was the green. Wild,
								unpredictable, chafing at the slightestrestriction. “Get her over here!”
							</p>

							<p>
								The green tester saw the mistress’s summons and walked right over. Allthe testers were
								beautiful, and if being light-skinned was a detriment on thebattlefield, it was favored
								for this and a few other ceremonies. The visualeffect of a man or woman whose skin was
								green or blue or red was moremuted the darker their natural skin tone. Even the Parians
								chose coastal,lowland, or mixed-blood countrymen to represent them in this ceremony.This
								woman was Ruthgari, and light-skinned even for them. She movedwith the easy grace of a
								dancer. Her thin green robe, thrown on during theceremony so that all the testers would
								be clad in their colors when thesupplicant emerged—which might be only ten or fifteen
								seconds after theirtesting began—was, in her case, open deep between her large breasts.
								Shewalked up eagerly, throwing her hair back, back straight, standing just onthe other
								side of the table.
							</p>

							<p>
								The nudity and near-nudity of some of the ceremonies were shrouded inreligious and
								cultural symbolism that made them almost non-erotic. Almost,because no matter how
								high-minded you might be, you couldn’t completelyignore the fact that you were looking
								at someone who was naked andastoundingly attractive. But the parties afterward,
								especially at initiations,were always a gray area. Everyone beautiful, everyone
								half-clad, everyonewith the fresh memory of everyone else stark naked, the
								atmospherejubilant, the wine flowing freely, and the somber ceremonialism
								suddenlyremoved.
							</p>

							<p>
								This green knew exactly what she was doing. Gavin was taller than thewoman, so he could
								barely help but stare down her barely closed robe.Instead, he looked at her heart-shaped
								face, hazel eyes, the pupils barelyhaloed in green. She looked familiar.“Over here,” he
								said, pointing next to him, between himself and
							</p>

							<p>
								Mistress Varidos. She stepped around the stone table to where he’d pointed,but closer in
								than necessary.“Who are you?” he asked, his voice cool.“My name’s Tisis,” she said, her
								smile showing off great dimples.“Tisis what?”“Oh,” she said, as if she didn’t have a
								thought in her head. “Tisis
							</p>

							<p>
								Malargos.”“What happened, Tisis?” he asked, pretending not to recognize thename. Her
								father and uncle had been his friends—that was, his Dazen’s.They’d disappeared after the
								war. Killed by bandits or enslaved by pirates,most likely. She had the family look. No
								doubt she hated him. She’d seenthat Kip had a chance of passing the test, so she’d
								sabotaged him. Gutsy.Foolish and infuriating, but gutsy.“The supplicant cheated,” she
								said. “He threw out the rope. I put it backin his hand.”“You’re not to touch the
								supplicant in any way during the testing. Isthere something about that rule that’s
								unclear?”“I didn’t touch him—Pardon me, High Luxlord Prism, I put the ropeback in his
								hand without touching his skin. I was trying to preserve theintegrity of the
								test.”“Malargos,” Gavin said. “You’re Ruthgari, right?”“Yes, Lord Prism.”Gavin looked at
								her flatly. “When your own Blessed Satrap Radoscrossed the Great River to fight the
								Blood Foresters who outnumbered himtwo to one, do you remember what he did?”“He burned
								Rozanos Bridge behind his army,” she said.“Was that cheating?”“I—I don’t follow,” she
								said.“He burned the bridge so his men knew they couldn’t flee. He gavethem no way out.
								Every last man knew he had to win or die. It’s where weget the expression ‘burning your
								bridges behind you.’ ”“But I saw him reaching for the rope,” she complained weakly.
								Sheswallowed, suddenly unnerved to have contradicted the Prism to his face.“And you gave
								it back to him.”“Of course.”“So you would have built a new bridge behind Blessed Satrap
								Rados?”“Of course not, that would be…”“And doomed him. How long did you last before you
								pulled the rope?”
							</p>

							<p>
								Gavin asked.
							</p>

							<p>
								She flushed and looked away. “Seventeen seconds.” She pulled her robetighter around
								herself, finally covering up.“And you destroyed a young man’s chance at passing.”“We
								could retest—” she started.“You know we can’t. Once supplicants know it’s not real, the
								Thresherdoesn’t work. Everyone would say it was because he got special favor forbeing my
								nephew—”“I didn’t mean—”“And you know it!” Gavin said, only keeping his voice down
								witheffort.“It doesn’t matter what you meant,” Mistress Varidos hissed.While the
								mistress was speaking, Gavin split some superviolet from thelight of the torches. Just a
								little. The beauty of superviolet was itsinvisibility. Even though there were at least
								half a dozen people in this roomwho could see superviolet luxin if they tightened their
								eyes, Gavin wasbetting that none of them was tightening her eyes at this very moment.
								Andeven if someone was, what Gavin was about to do was so small and soquick that even
								someone looking might miss it. Magical sleight of hand.The superviolet settled into his
								fingertips.“You broke the rules, Tisis,” the mistress said. “You botched your duties,and
								you may have destroyed a young man’s future.”“But nobody passes!” the young woman
								protested. It had become amark of pride just to hold on for a long time. Conspiracies,
								the dark, tightspaces, heights, spiders, snakes, rats—the Thresher hit all of the
								mostcommon fears. Usually, believing that failure would mean the loss ofeverything and
								with their eyes dilated from fear, the applicant drafted anyand all colors before they
								pulled the rope. It wasn’t perfect, of course, but itwas the best test they had.“Get out
								of my sight,” Gavin said.
							</p>

							<p>
								She went, huffing, furious, crossing between Gavin and the mistress,just as Gavin had
								planned. He pulled a stone from his pocket, holding theshort rod behind his wrist, slid
								the samite off the hole, flicked invisiblesuperviolet out of his fingertips and used it
								to snatch the testing stone out ofits grooves. He snapped the luxin back to his wrist,
								binding the testing stoneto his forearm with bands of superviolet, and with the last of
								the supervioletin his finger dropped the false testing stone into place.
							</p>

							<p>
								It had all taken less than a second, and Gavin hadn’t so much as leanedover. “Well,
								let’s see what we have, shall we?” he said, still drawing the richsamite cloth away from
								the hole.
							</p>

							<p>
								In full view of Mistress Varidos, Gavin set the samite aside and reachedinto the
								receptacle, leaning over, grabbing the testing stone, and pulling itout. The testing
								stone was an ivory bar—either from sea demon washedashore or from elephants deep within
								Ruthgar—tipped on each end withobsidian. The ivory was precious, but the obsidian was
								the real wonder. Noone knew where the obsidian extant in the world had been harvested,
								ormined, or made. Obsidian was rarer than diamonds or rubies, so after everytesting the
								obsidian ends of each testing stone were removed to be reused.
							</p>

							<p>
								The superstitious called it hellstone. Most drafters were just happy that itwas rare,
								because it was the only stone that could draw luxin directly out ofa drafter. Gavin had
								heard that in the ancient world kings and satraps—andin more mythic tales, the assassins
								of the Broken Eye—had created entiredaggers or even swords of obsidian. But obsidian
								only evinced its magicalproperties when two very special conditions were met. First, it
								had to be innear-total darkness: that is, a total lack of light in the visible
								spectrum—forsome reason superviolet and sub-red didn’t interfere with it. Second,
								itneeded the drafter’s blood, an open cut at that. There had to be a directphysical
								connection between the obsidian and the luxin for the luxin to bedrawn out of the
								drafter. When that connection was made, however, the pullwas quite strong. Cut a
								drafter’s shoulder with obsidian while he washolding luxin in his hand and hold the
								stone against the cut, and withinmaybe ten seconds the luxin would be gone. Scholars
								speculated that wasbecause drafters had luxin throughout their bodies at all times, so
								theconnection was direct, even if it was distant within the body.
							</p>

							<p>
								Because the rates at which obsidian pulled colors out of a person weredifferent for the
								different kinds of luxin, they made nice lines as they werepulled out of the body and
								into the ivory. If a color formed and stayed andwas thick enough, the supplicant was
								deemed worthy of receiving trainingin that color. If there were two colors, of course,
								the supplicant was deemeda bichrome, and more than two made them a polychrome.
							</p>

							<p>
								Gavin took the testing stone. He caught a faint whiff of cloves that wasthe scent of
								superviolet luxin. He held it for just a moment, willing the scentto disperse, and
								handed the stone to Mistress Varidos. As the head tester, itwas her place to declare the
								findings. As he did, everyone else gatheredaround. She carefully removed the obsidian
								tips and stowed them in aspecial box, and then held the testing stone over her head.
								There was aclear, thick green bar, peaking toward the blue side, and next to it a less
								fullblue. Yellow was faint. There was a tiny bit in the superviolet. It was aclassic
								bell, the most common pattern in drafters.
							</p>

							<p>
								The mistress said, “I hereby declare Kip of Rekton gifted of Orholam inthe colors green
								and blue, with superviolet undecided and to be testedfurther at a later date. Kip,
								congratulations, you’re a bichrome.”
							</p>

							<p>
								A cheer went up.Only Kip still looked confused.Gavin walked around the table, put an arm
								around Kip’s shoulder, andsqueezed. “Well done, Kip.”
							</p>

							<p>
								Kip was limp in Gavin’s embrace. “So I passed?” he asked quietly.“You passed. You made
								me proud.”Another cheer went up, and within no time, wine and brandy and specialcakes
								and fruits and meats and sweetmeats were being produced by slaveswho flooded the
								chamber.
							</p>

							<p>
								Gavin released the boy, who was looking at him like he was utterlybefuddled, like he
								couldn’t believe the words Gavin had just said. Some ofthat, too, was the magic. The
								emotional effects of every part of the spectrumhad just passed through Kip for the very
								first time. He didn’t know yet whatto do with the residue. It took time. Gavin gestured
								toward the door,beckoning Aliviana.“Kip,” Gavin said. “I’ve brought you someone special.
								A surprise foryou. She’ll be your mentor. She’ll explain how things work and teach
								yousome of the basics until we leave. Kip, may I present—”“Liv?!” Kip said as the girl
								stepped out from behind Gavin.“Kip!”“Why don’t you go ahead and take him up to his room,
								Liv,” Gavin said.“And remember what I said.”
							</p>

							<p>
								Kip was still in a daze, so Liv took his hand and turned to lead himtoward the main
								door. There would be a crowd there, no doubt. No need forKip to think anything was out
								of the usual.“Why don’t you go the back way?” Gavin said. He turned and flungsuperviolet
								at the opposite wall. A section of the wall popped open onpreviously hidden hinges.
							</p>

							<p>
								Liv took Kip out the back door.Commander Ironfist and Luxlord Black came in the front
								door.“Luxlord, Mistress, Commander, Magisters,” Gavin said, waving afriendly hand to
								show he was simply too busy just now to speak withIronfist or Luxlord Black. He walked
								toward the back door himself. Heneeded to get Kip now. He should have commanded the boy
								to wait outsidethe room instead of sending him upstairs.
							</p>

							<p>
								Gavin stepped through the back door, already composing the letter hewould leave for the
								White, and almost ran over a dark, demure little man ina slave’s robe. He recognized the
								man and his heart dropped.“Greetings, Lord Prism,” the little man said, his headscarf so
								starched itbarely moved as he bobbed his head. He’d been a Parian legalist beforebeing
								captured by Ilytian pirates, enslaved, and eventually sold to AndrossGuile. Brilliant
								and discreet, he’d been Andross Guile’s right hand fortwenty years. “Your father tires
								of your delays. He demands you come tohis chambers immediately.”
							</p>

							<p>
								With Andross Guile, “immediately” meant yesterday. Gavin cringedinside, popped his neck
								right and left, and said, “Take me to him.”
							</p>

							<p>
								Chapter 46
							</p>

							<p>
								Kip followed Liv Danavis through a narrow hall and then out to a lift. Hishead was still
								awhirl and his emotions were a riot that seemed notcompletely internal, as if somehow,
								additional emotions were being pressedonto him. It felt alien. Maybe it was just seeing
								Liv. He’d known she was atthe Chromeria, and he’d hoped to see her ever since he’d known
								he wascoming here, but actually seeing her was different.
							</p>

							<p>
								Master Danavis had shared many of Liv’s letters with Kip, so in someways it didn’t feel
								like it had been two full years, but she’d been fifteenthen. He’d been thirteen.
								Apparently, he’d grown since then, because hewas finally taller than she was. Of course,
								he was still also about three timeswider than she was. If anything, she was even more
								beautiful than she hadbeen.
							</p>

							<p>
								As she led him through a hall and finally to a lift, she didn’t sayanything. Kip was
								glad for the silence. He didn’t think he could have foundhis tongue. An odd, quiet joy
								and peace settled over him at seeing her. Heremembered when she was fourteen years old
								and the rumor had run aroundtown that she was going to be betrothed to Ged, the
								alcaldesa’s son. Shortlythereafter, she’d left for the Chromeria. Kip had been relieved.
								She’dseemed too good for little Rekton. But though he was sure she hadn’tthought of him
								since, he’d missed her. She had been like the sun passingoverhead, and he’d turned his
								face as she passed, warmed by her presence,but never daring to hope for more. When
								Master Danavis had shared thatLiv was having a hard time with some girl at the
								Chromeria, Kip hadwanted to leave immediately and kill the offender, then come home.
							</p>

							<p>
								Seeing her wavy hair swish and bounce around her shoulders as she ledhim was like
								standing in the sunlight again after a long winter. Kip didn’twant words. Once he opened
								his big mouth, he’d surely spoil everything.He just watched her walk, hiking up his own
								pants gracelessly as she strodeahead, purposefully, at home, at ease, in command of her
								environment.“I think I’m lost,” Liv said. She looked to each side, down halls thatlooked
								exactly the same. She bit her lip.
							</p>

							<p>
								Eyes locked on that full, slightly moist lip, Kip gulped.“Kip?” she said. “No, never
								mind, of course you wouldn’t.”She headed off again, and Kip followed. Liv had turned
								into a woman inthe time she’d been away. She was as slender as he was fat. Her eyes
								largelucid brown, her skin smooth and clear where his was cursed with pimplesaround his
								neck and jaw as his beard was only just coming in. ThankOrholam, at least her chest was
								bigger than his.
							</p>

							<p>
								Kip barely glanced there, though, and now as he followed her, he barelylooked at her
								body. Her skirt did swoosh back and forth in a most pleasingmanner as she walked,
								revealing slim, well-turned calves. But aside from aglance or two, or maybe three—Kip
								glanced again. Ah! Four. Aside fromthat, he didn’t look at her the way he’d look at some
								other beautiful woman.It just didn’t seem respectful.
							</p>

							<p>
								Oops, five.She stopped when they got into the lift. “I just realized,” she said,laughing
								at herself, “that I have no idea where I’m supposed to take you.Uh, tell you what. You
								can come to my room until I get this figured out. Ifyou’re like I was after the
								Threshing, you’ll probably need to go straight tobed. Right?”
							</p>

							<p>
								Kip wasn’t sure how he hadn’t noticed before, but he was tired. He feltas if someone had
								taken the bottle of his energy and shaken it all out. Henodded his head.“Don’t feel like
								talking?” she asked, giving him a little grin. It was thekind of grin you gave a little
								child who’d missed nap time and was fightingto stay up to get dessert. But Kip couldn’t
								even summon the passion todespair at seeing that indulgent grin on her.
							</p>

							<p>
								I’m cute to her. Cute. Ugh.She set the counterweights on the lift, paused for a
								moment—she musthave been surprised how much weight she needed to add to account for
								Kip—and added more. In moments, they were speeding up the tower, passingother students
								going both up and down. They stopped and stepped into awide lobby area that dimpled out
								to one of the clear tubes that connectedthe central tower to all the others.
							</p>

							<p>
								Kip looked at Liv, eyebrows up.“My apartments are over in yellow. Yellow’s in the middle
								of thespectrum, so bichromes and polychromes include yellow more often thanother colors,
								so the yellow tower has more bichrome apartments. Theydon’t have the space for those in
								the Prism’s Tower. Are you afraid ofheights?”“Not usually,” Kip said uneasily.“Oh, so
								you can talk!”“I can fall too,” he mumbled.“You’ll be fine, I promise,” she said. She
								walked out into the tube. Itwas four paces across and enclosed with blue luxin so thin
								it was almostclear. The bottom of the walkway was thicker blue reinforced with thin
								barsof yellow. It looked impossibly thin. As Kip had seen from far, far below,the
								walkway attached to the Prism’s Tower only at two places: on the eastside and here, on
								the west. After going straight out about halfway to thegreen tower that was directly
								west of the Prism’s Tower, this walkway met agreat almost clear luxin circular walkway.
								From that circle, there werespokes out to each of the six towers.
							</p>

							<p>
								Liv led Kip out to one of those intersections between circle and spokes,the point
								farthest from any support. She jumped up and down. “See, totallysafe.” She laughed. “Now
								you try it.”“I don’t know,” Kip said. If he could ever overcome his fear, the viewfrom
								up here was magnificent. Of course, it was hard to look at mere magictowers when he had
								Liv right here. “Okay,” he said weakly. He didn’t wantto let her down.
							</p>

							<p>
								Of course, if I break this spindly walkway, I’ll be letting us both down.
							</p>

							<p>
								The quick way.
							</p>

							<p>
								Trying to be a good sport, Kip hopped a little, landing as lightly aspossible on his
								toes and absorbing all the shock in his knees.“Oh, seriously,” Liv said.Kip sighed and
								jumped so high he thought he was going to touch hishead on the canopy. As he landed, he
								heard a loud crack.
							</p>

							<p>
								He threw his hands out looking for something to grab, his heart seizingup. He was about
								to throw himself at the handrail when he saw Liv’s face.
							</p>

							<p>
								She laughed and covered her mouth. “I am so sorry,” she said. “Ishouldn’t have. It’s
								kind of a tradition for new students, and the Prismwanted me to give you the whole
								experience.” Kip looked at her hands.They seemed to be clenched around something
								invisible. He tightened hiseyes, and sure enough, she had a bar of superviolet luxin
								snapped in herhands.
							</p>

							<p>
								Kip chuckled. It only sounded a little forced. “Give me the traditionalmop, would you? I
								think I left a traditional puddle.”
							</p>

							<p>
								She laughed. “Thanks for being a good sport. If it makes you feel better,
							</p>

							<p>
								I almost fainted when my magister did it with our whole class. Come on,it’s just a
								little farther now.”
							</p>

							<p>
								They walked together around the spindly circle, then turned toward theyellow tower. The
								yellow tower had been at the back right when Kip hadentered the Great Yard, so he hadn’t
								really seen it. Now it loomed bothabove and below.“I think my eyes are full,” Kip
								said.“What?”“I’ve seen too many amazing things today. Either this is just not
								asimpressive, or I’ve lost my ability to be amazed, because to me, this lookslike a
								plain yellow tower. No flames, no jewels, no twisty movement.” Thetower was luminous,
								but otherwise it looked like cloudy yellow glass,translucent, but not transparent. Maybe
								it was hard to see because the sunwas going down beside the tower.
							</p>

							<p>
								Liv smiled. He didn’t know how he’d forgotten her dimples. “Theyellow is amazing because
								it’s made entirely of yellow luxin.”“And the others aren’t,” Kip said, not
								understanding. He blinked. “Imean, they’re not made of their own colored luxin?”“No, no,
								no. The others have magical façades built over traditionalbuilding materials. The yellow
								is made entirely of yellow.”
							</p>

							<p>
								From his admittedly brief instruction with the Prism, Kip thought thatyellow was used
								like magical lanolin or something—it nourished otherluxin, but otherwise degraded back
								into light easily. “Uh, I thought yellowwas kind of a bad choice for a building
								material, being unstable and all.”Kip was just remembering why he had been keeping his
								mouth shut. Themore he talked with Liv, the more natural it would be for him to talk
								abouthome. And the more unnatural for him not to say anything about home. Themoment they
								went there, he was going to have to tell Liv her father wasdead, and the pleasant ease
								of being in her company would be shattered.She would go from this bright, glowing,
								dimpled young woman to abereaved orphan.“It is a bad choice,” Liv said. “That’s why this
								is so amazing.” Shepulled him toward the tower’s entrance. Suddenly Kip didn’t know if
								hewanted to leave the solidity of the blue-yellow spindles.
							</p>

							<p>
								Sure, a minute ago, I was worried to step out on these, and now I don’twant to
								leave.“Yellow is usually the least stable luxin. It shimmers right back intolight at the
								least movement, like water boiling away in a moment. That’swhy they call it brightwater.
								But do you remember when that harper playeda few years ago back in Rekton, and he
								stopped between every song toretune his harp?”
							</p>

							<p>
								Kip nodded. “It didn’t seem to make any difference to me.” Dangerousground, talking
								about anything back home, but if he could keep her talkinguntil he collapsed from
								exhaustion, he might avoid telling her the news forone more day.
							</p>

							<p>
								Liv said, “The thing was, he could tell when his harp was even a fractionout of tune. No
								one else could, though. There are people who can do thatwith light. To make luxin of any
								color, you have to hit the right note withinthe color or the luxin won’t form. If you
								are only approximately on pitch,the luxin is much more likely to fail. You can cover
								some mistakes withmore will, but you need someone really special to do work like
								this.”“Does this have something to do with superchromats?” Kip asked. Hefelt like he was
								finally starting to put together some pieces.“Yes.” She seemed surprised that he’d heard
								of that. “You’re not reallygoing to stand out there all night, are you?”“Oh.” Kip
								followed her into the tower.“Superchromats can see finer gradations in colors than most
								people.”“Are you one?” Kip asked.“Mmm-hmm. About half of all women are.”“But not that
								many men.”“There are only ten male superchromats in the entire Chromeria.”Ah, thus
								Mistress Hag calling Kip a freak. “That doesn’t seem fair,” Kipsaid.“What does fair have
								to do with it? Because you’re blue-eyed you’ll beable to draft more than I can. It’s not
								a matter of fair.”
							</p>

							<p>
								Kip frowned. “So you’ve got to be a superchromat to make yellowstay?”“Short answer? Yes.
								In truth, even superchromacy has degrees to it. Youtook that superchromacy test and
								there were maybe a hundred blocks withfine gradations? Imagine there were a thousand
								blocks, with the gradationsof color that much finer. To make solid yellow that will
								stay, you’d have topass that test—and then have the control to draft yellow in that
								tight, tightspectrum. The result, though, is the strongest of any luxin.”“Can you do
								it?” Kip asked.“No.”“Uh, that was probably a rude question, huh?” Kip asked, wrinkling
								hisface.“I’m the last person here who’s going to hold the minutiae of toweretiquette
								against you.”“Which is a yes.”“Yes,” she said, smiling. Why were dimples so beautiful,
								anyway? “Istill can’t believe you’re the Prism’s… nephew, Kip.”“You’re not the only
								one,” Kip said. So Gavin had been right. They alldid pause before they said nephew. He
								guessed it should have felt betterthan hearing that he was a bastard all the time. It
								didn’t.
							</p>

							<p>
								They got on another lift and went down. Apparently there was some sortof order of
								precedence for who got what rooms. When they got into Liv’sroom, Kip was surprised. It
								was not only large, but it was a suite of rooms—and facing the sunset. This had to be
								the kind of room most drafterswould kill for.“I just moved here,” Liv said
								apologetically. “I’m a bichrome. Barely.
							</p>

							<p>
								I’m sure you’re exhausted. You can sleep in my bed.”
							</p>

							<p>
								Kip looked at her, flabbergasted, sure that she wasn’t saying what hethought she was
								saying, trying not to let his expression say anything at all.“I’ll sleep in the next
								room, silly. These new carpets are so thick I cansleep on them like a Parian.”
							</p>

							<p>
								Kip swallowed. “No, I didn’t think you were—I mean, I was just—um, Iwas thinking I
								shouldn’t take your bed. I should sleep in the next room.”“You’re my guest, and you’ve
								got to be exhausted. I insist.”“I’m, uh, I don’t want to get your bed all dirty. I’m
								sweaty and gross.
							</p>

							<p>
								From the testing.” Kip was looking at her bed. It was beautiful. Everythinghere was
								beautiful. At least they’d been treating her well.“The Thresher does that to people.
								I’ll get you a basin and you cansponge off a little before you pass out, but really, I
								insist.”
							</p>

							<p>
								Liv disappeared into the next room. Kip felt a lump growing in histhroat. He hadn’t said
								anything so far about her father, but he couldpractically feel the subject growing
								between them. Liv came back in theroom with steaming hot water, a sponge, and a thick
								towel. She set themdown and then sat in a chair, facing away from Kip.“You don’t mind if
								I sit here and chat while you wash, do you?” sheasked. “I won’t turn around,
								swear.”“Uh.” Of course he minded. She’d turn around when he was half nakedand run
								screaming from the room, for Orholam’s sake. It was one thing forsomeone to know you
								were rotund, but it was something else entirely forthem to see your fat rolls. At the
								same time, he was her guest and she hadn’tasked anything else of him. And he’d been
								rude.“So, Kip… how’s my father? You haven’t said anything about home.”For a long moment,
								Kip couldn’t say anything. Just start talking, Kip.
							</p>

							<p>
								Once you start, you’ll be able to tell her everything.“You’re sighing,” Liv said. “Is
								something wrong?”“You know how the satrap would send messengers to Rekton every
								yearasking for levies?”“Yes?” Liv said her voice rising more with concern than asking
								aquestion.“You can turn around, I’m not naked.”She turned.“When Satrap Garadul’s son
								Rask took power, he declared himself king.
							</p>

							<p>
								He sent another messenger. The town sent that one away empty-handed too,so he decided to
								make an example of us.” Kip heaved a deep breath. “Theykilled everyone, Liv. I’m the
								only one who got away.”“My father? What about my father?”“He was trying to save people.
								But Liv, they completely surrounded thetown. No one got out.”“You got out.” She didn’t
								believe him; he could see it on her face.“I was lucky.”“My father is one of the most
								talented drafters of his generation. Don’ttell me that you made it out and he
								didn’t.”“They had drafters and Mirrormen, Liv. I watched the Delclara familyget run
								down. All of them. The whole town was on fire. I watched Ram and
							</p>

								Isa and Sanson die. I watched my mother die.”“I don’t care about your drug-addled
								mother. I’m talking about myfather! Don’t you tell me he’s dead. He’s not, damn you.
								He’s not!”
							</p>

							<p>
								Liv left the room in a whirlwind and slammed the door behind her.Kip stared at the door,
								his shoulders slumped, tears that he didn’t evenunderstand in his eyes.

							<p>
								Well, that went well.

								Chapter 47
							</p>

							<p>
								Seven years, seven great purposes, Gavin.
							</p>

							<p>
								Gavin held his right hand out and counted up from his thumb, draftingeach color in turn:
								thumb to pinky, to ring finger, to middle finger, to indexfinger, back to middle, to
								ring, to pinky. A seven count, each color in turn,from sub-red to superviolet, feeling
								the little thread of emotion from each.
							</p>

							<p>
								For Orholam’s sake, I’m the Prism. I am the whole man. Master of allcolors. In my prime.
								Stronger than any Prism in living memory. Maybe thestrongest for hundreds of years. Most
								Prisms only lived seven years aftertheir ascension. Only four had made it to twenty-one
								years. Always inmultiples of seven—of course, they could be killed or die of natural
								causestoo, but none burned out except on the multiple years. Gavin had made it
								tosixteen, so he had at least five years left. In fact, if any Prism could make itpast
								twenty-one years, he would be the one to do it. He felt strong. He feltstronger and more
								in control of his colors than he had in his whole life.
							</p>

							<p>
								Of course, it could all be an illusion. He’d been exceptional in otherways; perhaps he’d
								pitch over and die tomorrow.
							</p>

							<p>
								He felt that familiar tightness in his chest again at the thought. Hewasn’t afraid of
								death, but he was afraid of dying before he accomplishedhis purposes.
							</p>

							<p>
								He stood outside his father’s apartments in the Prism’s Tower. Hisfather’s slave—Gavin
								knew the man’s name was Grinwoody, though it wasrude to use a slave’s name if they
								didn’t reveal it to you themselves—waswaiting, holding the door open. It was a door into
								darkness of more thanone kind. There was sharp pain in Gavin’s chest. It was hard to
								breathe.
							</p>

							<p>
								Andross Guile didn’t know Gavin wasn’t Gavin. He didn’t know hiselder son was rotting
								under the Chromeria. He thought Dazen was dead,and he’d never seemed concerned about it,
								much less sorry. Traitors were tobe dismissed and never spoken of.“Lord Prism?” the
								slave asked.Gavin shook the last tendrils of luxin from his fingers, the waft ofresinous
								smells a small comfort.
							</p>

							<p>
								Andross Guile’s room was kept completely dark. Thick velvet drapeshad been hung over the
								windows, then the whole wall hung with more ofthe same in layers. An entry chamber had
								been erected around the entranceso that light from the hallway wouldn’t come in with his
								few visitors. Gavindrew in superviolet light and then stepped into the entry.
							</p>

							<p>
								Grinwoody pulled the door shut behind them. Gavin drew a little ball ofsuperviolet into
								his hand, drafted imperfectly so it would be unstable. Theinstability caused it to
								slowly disintegrate back into light of its ownspectrum. For a superviolet drafter, it
								was like carrying a torch whose lightwas invisible to everyone else. Neither Grinwoody
								nor Andross was asuperviolet, so Gavin could have as much of the eerie violet light as
								hewanted.
							</p>

							<p>
								As Gavin watched, Grinwoody pushed a heavy pillow in front of theslight crack at the
								bottom of the door behind them. The man paused, lettinghis eyes become used to the
								darkness. He wasn’t a drafter, so he couldn’tdirectly control his eyes. In darkness, it
								took a dull—a non-drafter—half anhour or more to reach full sensitivity to light. Most
								drafters naturally coulddo it in ten minutes, just from spending so much time attuned to
								light. Afew could reach full light sensitivity in seconds. But Grinwoody wasn’ttrying to
								see. He had obviously memorized the layout of the room yearsago; he was simply making
								sure he wasn’t allowing any light into HighMaster Guile’s chamber. Finally, satisfied,
								he opened the door.
							</p>

							<p>
								Gavin was glad to be holding superviolet. Like all drafters, he’d beentaught not to rely
								on colors to change his moods. Like most, he failed often.It was a particular temptation
								for polychromes. There was a color for everyfeeling, or to counteract every feeling.
								Like right now. Using the supervioletspectrum was attended by a sense of remove or
								alienation or otherness.Sometimes it seemed ironic or cynical. Always it was like
								looking down athimself from above.
							</p>

							<p>
								You’re the Prism, and you’re afraid of an old man.
							</p>

							<p>
								In the superviolet light of his torch, Gavin saw his father sitting in ahigh-backed
								padded chair turned toward a covered, boarded-up window.Andross Guile had been a tall,
								powerfully built man. Now his weight haddropped from his broad shoulders to form a
								little ball in his paunch. Hewasn’t corpulent; it was just that what weight he had was
								in his gut. Hisarms and legs had grown thin from years spent hardly moving from
								thatchair, his skin loose and spotted already at sixty-five.“Son, so good of you to come
								visit. An old man grows lonely.”“I’m sorry, father. The White keeps me very busy.”“You
								shouldn’t be so supine with that wheeled wench. You shouldarrange for the hag to join
								the Freeing this year.”
							</p>

							<p>
								Gavin let that pass without comment. It was an old argument. The Whitesaid the same
								things about Andross, minus the derogation. Gavin sat besidehis father and studied him
								in the eerie superviolet light of his torch.
							</p>

							<p>
								Despite the absolute darkness of the room, Andross Guile woreblackened spectacles molded
								tight around his eye sockets. Gavin couldn’timagine living in utter darkness. He hadn’t
								even done that to his brother.Andross Guile had been a yellow to sub-red polychrome.
								Like so manyother drafters during the False Prism’s War, he’d pushed himself to
								hisabsolute limit. And beyond. He’d fought, of course, for his eldest son.Using too much
								magic, he’d finally destroyed his body’s defenses against it.But after the war, when so
								many drafters had taken the Freeing, Androsshad instead withdrawn to these rooms. When
								Gavin had first come to visitAndross here, there had been blue filters set on the
								windows. With his ownpower at the opposite end of the spectrum, Andross had felt safe
								with bluelight. Since then, the chirurgeons had told him he needed complete darknessif
								he was to keep fighting the colors. If he was taking such extremeprecautions, he must be
								very close to the brink indeed.“I hear you’re trying to start a war,” Andross said.“I
								rarely try without succeeding, I’m afraid,” Gavin said. He didn’tbother marveling that
								his father already knew. Of course Andross Guileknew. The man owned the loyalty or the
								fear of half of the most powerfulwomen and men in the tower.“How?”“I received a letter
								that I had a natural son in Tyrea. When I arrived, thetown was burning. I stumbled
								across some Mirrormen about to murder achild and I stopped them.”“Killed them.”“Yes. The
								child turned out to be my natural son, and the men turned outto be Rask Garadul’s. He
								was making an example of the town for refusingto send levies. He claimed a special
								interest in the boy, but I’m not sure ifthat was just because he thought it would hurt
								me.”“A special interest? I thought he was there to punish the village.”“He said Kip had
								stolen something from him.”“And had he?”“The boy claimed his mother had given him a
								jewelry case just beforedying from injuries she took during the attack. He didn’t steal
								it, though.”“But you have the dagger? Is it the white luxin?”A chill shot down Gavin’s
								spine. He’d thought the worst part of thisinterview would be his father picking through
								the details of affairs thatGavin hadn’t actually had and thus couldn’t remember. A white
								luxindagger? White luxin wasn’t possible, and for Andross Guile to speak aboutit like
								this meant he thought that it was. Or knew that it was. That he’d seensuch a thing, and
								that he thought Gavin should know what he was talkingabout.
							</p>

							<p>
								His brother had mentioned a dagger too. Gavin’s chest tightened.If he wasn’t very
								careful, he was going to ruin his disguise. This waswhy he avoided his father as much as
								possible. Andross Guile was one ofthe few people who would know exactly which memories
								Gavin wouldhave and which Dazen would have. Others who knew had been alienated orkilled
								during the war. The feeble excuse that the severity of the brothers’fight to the death
								had made Gavin forget things would only go so far.Andross, in particular, might forgive
								him for misremembering things thathappened in the run-up to the final battle, but surely
								Gavin would rememberthings that had happened years earlier, wouldn’t he?“I didn’t see
								the dagger,” Gavin said. “It was in a box. It didn’t evenoccur to me it might be the
								white luxin.” White luxin was impossible.Gavin would know. He’d tried to make the mythic
								material himself—and asa Prism, he would be the one who was able to do it if it could be
								done at all.“Idiot boy, I don’t know why I always favored you. Dazen was smarterby half,
								but I always took your side, didn’t I?”
							</p>

							<p>
								Gavin looked at the ground and nodded. The first kind word he’d heardfrom his father
								about himself in years, and it was delivered as a rebuke.“Are you nodding your head or
								shaking it? In case you’d forgotten, I’mblind,” Andross said bitterly. “Never mind. I
								understand your own secrecyin hunting the dagger—even my spies haven’t heard of you
								bumbling about,so bravo for that—but when you stumbled across a suspicious dagger
								thatsome halfpenny king wanted badly, that didn’t send shivers up the back ofyour
								neck?”“I was surrounded by thirty hostile drafters, Mirrormen, and anextremely put-out
								king. I had plenty of shivers.”
							</p>

							<p>
								Andross Guile waved his hand, like none of that was worth considering.“With no
								Blackguards guarding you, I suppose. Stubborn, fool boy. Whatwas the box made
								of?”“Rosewood, maybe?” Gavin said honestly.“Rosewood.” Andross Guile sighed deeply.
								“Alone it proves nothing, ofcourse. But it tells you what you have to do.”“I was
								planning to rally the Seven Satrapies, speak to each directly, seeif I could sway them,”
								Gavin said. “The Spectrum, of course, will donothing.” He knew how this went. His father
								would announce what Gavinwould do and run right over everything Gavin threw in his path.
								ForOrholam’s sake, I’m the Prism.“And by the time you’ve done that, King Garadul will
								have taken
							</p>

							<p>
								Garriston. You were right in everything you told the Spectrum, though youdrew the wrong
								lesson and the wrong course of action. Which is why youhave me. If you’d spoken with me
								as soon as you returned, I’d have toldyou this. By withdrawing unilaterally and giving a
								jewel into Tyrean hands—”“Hardly a jewel, father—”“You dare interrupt! Come
								here.”Woodenly, Gavin sat across from his father. Andross Guile extended ahand and found
								Gavin’s face. He traced Gavin’s cheek almost gently. Thenhe drew his open hand back and
								cracked it across Gavin’s cheek.“I am your father, and you will give me the respect you
								owe me,understood?”
							</p>

							<p>
								Gavin trembled, swallowed, mastered himself. “Understood, father.”Andross Guile’s chin
								lifted as if he was sifting Gavin’s tone for anythingdispleasing. Then, as if nothing
								had happened, he continued. “Garadulcovets Garriston, so even if it’s a tower of feces
								built on a plain of ordure,giving it to him is weakness. The right course would be to
								raze the city,enslave the inhabitants, and sow the fields with salt—and leave before
								hearrived. But you’ve destroyed that option with your incompetence. Andonce King Garadul
								holds Garriston with twenty thousand men, you’ll find ita lot harder to take back than
								he’s going to find it to take when only athousand are holding it.”“The Ruthgari only
								have a thousand men holding Garriston?” Gavinasked. It was less than a skeleton crew. If
								he hadn’t been in such a hurrywhen he sculled through Garriston, he surely would have
								noticed.“Troubles with the Aborneans hiking the tariff to travel through the
							</p>

							<p>
								Narrows again. The Ruthgari are making a statement with a show of force.They pulled the
								ships and most of the soldiers from Garriston.”“That’s moronic. They have to know
								Garadul is massing troops.”“I agree. I think the Ruthgari foreign minister has been
								suborned. She’ssmart, she must know what she’s doing. Regardless, you must go
								toGarriston. Save the city, kill Rask Garadul, but even if you fail those, getthat
								dagger. Everything rests on that.”
							</p>

							<p>
								What “everything”? Here was the problem with pretending to knowsecrets you didn’t know.
								Secrets, especially big, dangerous secrets, tendedto be referred to obliquely.
								Especially when the conspirators knew spieswere frequently eavesdropping on them.
							</p>

							<p>
								Maybe I should have taken my chances with claiming to have forgottenwhat the dagger was.
							</p>

							<p>
								There had been a time when Dazen had known all of Gavin’s secrets,even those that were
								supposed to be just between Gavin and their father.Dazen and Gavin hadn’t just been
								brothers. They’d been best friends.Though Dazen was two years younger, Gavin treated him
								like an equal.Sevastian was younger; they made him stay home. Gavin and Dazen hadthe
								same friends. Together, they won and lost fistfights against the WhiteOak brothers.
								Gavin missed the simplicity of those fights. Two sides, lots offists, and once one side
								started bleeding or crying, the fight was over.
							</p>

							<p>
								But Gavin had changed on the day he turned thirteen. Dazen was not yeteleven at the
								time. Andross Guile had come in his dress robes, looming,impressive in red-gold brocade
								and red-gold chains around his neck. Eventhen, after having been a member of the
								Spectrum for a decade, AndrossGuile had always been referred to as Andross Guile, never
								Andross Red.Everyone had always known which was the more important. Andross hadtaken
								Gavin away.
							</p>

							<p>
								When Gavin came back the next morning, his eyes were swollen like hehad been crying,
								though he angrily denied it when Dazen asked. Whateverhad happened, Gavin was never the
								same. He was a man now, he toldDazen, and he refused to play with him. When the White
								Oak brothers triedto pick a fight, Gavin filled himself with such deep sub-red that the
								heatemanated from him in waves, and he quietly told the brothers that if theyattacked
								him, the result would be on their own heads.
							</p>

							<p>
								In that moment, Dazen knew Gavin really would have killed them, too.From then on, Gavin
								had spoken to their father as a confidant. Dazenhad been left to fall by the wayside.
								For a time, he’d played with Sevastian.Then Sevastian was taken too, and he’d been
								alone. Dazen had hoped whenhe turned thirteen he’d be welcomed back into their graces,
								but his fatherhad barely acknowledged the date. When it came time for it to be
								divinedwhom Orholam had chosen to be his next Prism, all of Big Jasper and LittleJasper
								was a whirl of speculation, but Dazen knew his older brother was theone. How it happened
								didn’t matter. Andross had been grooming Gavin tobe Prism for his whole life.
							</p>

							<p>
								And I was groomed to be nothing. A castoff to marry Karris White Oakor some other girl
								to deflect some other father’s ambitions. Until Gavintried to take even that from me.
							</p>

							<p>
								The hardest part of maintaining his disguise was here—not in pretendingto be Gavin, but
								in being reminded of all Gavin had had and that Dazennever would.“So, go to Garriston,
								save it or burn it, kill Garadul, and get the dagger.
							</p>

							<p>
								Sounds simple enough.” If Gavin did things right, that would fulfill one ofhis purposes,
								and set the stage for another.
							</p>

							<p>
								Andross said, “I’ll give you letters to the Ruthgari to make sure they’llobey
								you.”“You’re going to make me the governor of Garriston?” Every time
							</p>

							<p>
								Gavin forgot how powerful his father was—even from this little room—Andross did
								something to remind him.“Not officially. If you fail it would besmirch our name. But I’m
								makingsure that the governor does whatever you tell him.”“But the Spectrum—”“Can, on
								occasion, be ignored. It’s so not easy to depose a Prism, youknow. When you return,
								we’ll talk about getting you married. It’s time youstart making heirs. You showing up
								with a bastard presses the issue.”“Father, I’m not—”“If you crush one of the satraps,
								even a rebel one, you’re going to needto buy off one of the others. It’s time. You will
								obey me in this. We’ll talkabout the bastard problem later.”
							</p>

							<p>
								Chapter 48
							</p>

							<p>
								Liv had gone to the light garden high in the yellow tower to think, but itseemed she
								couldn’t walk ten paces without stumbling over some youngcouple kissing. As the sun went
								down, the light garden became spectacular—and a favorite of couples. Liv should have
								remembered. There wassomething particularly jarring in the sight of young lovers when
								she wasfeeling so isolated.
							</p>

							<p>
								She left, her emotions tumbling over each other, sorry she’d been sorude to Kip, certain
								she was right that her father was still alive, and scaredto death she was wrong. Lonely,
								scared of her future, and now—hit in theface with how easy everyone else seemed to find
								it to find someone wholiked her—lonely for a boy. Any boy. Well, practically. Liv had
								been at theChromeria for three years, and the best she’d done was have a few near-misses
								at relationships. Being Tyrean, being the daughter of a general on thelosing side, and
								being poor had ended most interest before it began. The oneboy she’d thought really
								cared for her had invited her to the Luxlords’ Balland then had stood her up and gone
								with another girl. Apparently it hadbeen a prank. The next year she’d briefly become the
								object of acompetition between some of the most popular boys. For two weeks, it
								wasglorious to be the center of attention. She’d felt like she’d finally brokenthrough,
								that people were finally accepting her. One of them invited her tothe Luxlords’ Ball.
							</p>

							<p>
								Then she overheard one of the others talking about a wager they had tosee who could
								swive her first. Her revenge had been swift and terrible.She’d promised the boy
								escorting her to the ball—the leader of the group, ayoung noble named Parshan Payam—her
								maidenhead if he helped herfulfill a naughty dream of hers. He’d practically drooled.
							</p>

							<p>
								At the Luxlords’ Ball, they’d met in a darkened nook just off the mainhall. She’d
								convinced Parshan to remove all of his clothes first, despite theproximity of
								practically the entire Chromeria dancing, talking, and drinkingmere paces away. Then,
								pausing from kissing him while his loathsomehands wandered over her body, she asked how
								much he was going to winfor winning the contest.“You know? You’re not mad?” he
								asked.“Why would I be mad?” she asked. “Close your eyes. I’ve got a surprisefor you.”“A
								good surprise?” he asked.She trailed her fingernails down his belly. Looked down. Licked
								herlips. “It’ll take your breath away. Promise.”
							</p>

							<p>
								He closed his eyes. She grabbed all of his clothes and stormed out intothe party. He
								came after her with a yelp, rushing naked into the party. “Thisis what you get for your
								contest, Parsham Payam!” Liv shouted, just so thatanyone who hadn’t immediately seen the
								naked young man would noticeand know who it was.
							</p>

							<p>
								The dancers stopped. The musicians quit playing. A hundredconversations ceased.
								“Wagering with your friends on who can take myvirginity?! You’re despicable. A cad and a
								liar. You disgust me. You’re notsmart enough to fool me, you’re not clever enough to
								deceive me, andyou’re not man enough to take me.” She plunged his priceless clothes
								intothe punch bowl.
							</p>

							<p>
								Nervous titters broke out everywhere. Parshan froze. With his clothessoaking in punch,
								it was pointless to retrieve them to cover himself. He didhis best to cover himself with
								his hands.
							</p>

							<p>
								Amid silence punctuated with scattered applause, Liv stormed out of thehall and straight
								into Chromeria legend. Unfortunately, passing into towerlore for wreaking vengeance on a
								boy who’d taken a romantic interest inyou—regardless of how ignoble that interest
								was—was not a good way toencourage interest from others. All the other boys were
								terrified of her.
							</p>

							<p>
								Why am I thinking about boys? My father’s dead.No, he’s not. Father’s gotten out of
								worse things. He wouldn’t allowhimself to be trapped. He’s smarter than that.
							</p>

							<p>
								Still, it would be nice to have someone to talk to. Honestly, a good crywould make her
								feel a lot better.
							</p>

							<p>
								Liv trudged down to Vena’s room, but when she got there, Vena wascrying. It broke Liv
								out of her own self-pity instantly. Vena wasn’t justcrying; she was bawling. Vena’s
								usually artfully disheveled boyishly shorthair was smashed down on her head as if she’d
								been holding her head in herhands. Her eyes were swollen.“I can’t believe it, Liv! I’ve
								been looking for you everywhere. Liv!”
							</p>

							<p>
								Vena said. “It’s a disaster. Orholam, Liv, I’m being sent home!”
							</p>

							<p>
								Looking around the room, Liv saw that all of Vena’s stuff was alreadypacked up and in
								large trunks. With how much stuff Vena owned and all thedecorations she’d strewn over
								every open space in her little room, Liv knewshe couldn’t have packed it all
								herself.“What’s going on?”It took a few minutes to get it all out in some sort of
								sensible order, eventhough the story was simple: Vena had lost her sponsorship. The
								Aborneanlord who held her contract had lost a fortune in some business venture andneeded
								to cut his expenses. Apparently he’d shopped Vena’s contractaround and found no buyers.
								Some other, younger drafter’s lord had boughtVena’s room from him, though. She was to
								vacate it immediately. Vena hadbeen purchased passage home, tonight. She would have to
								meet with hersponsor to determine how he could best make back his investment from her.
							</p>

							<p>
								Vena could end up as a serving girl, but she feared her lord might sellher to slavers.
								It was illegal—a drafter’s indenture was a far cry fromslavery—but there were always
								stories of such things.“Liv, could you loan me some money? I could run away.”“I
								can’t—”“Please, Liv, I’m begging you. I know it’s not a loan. I’ll never be ableto pay
								you back, but I can’t face going back. Please.”
							</p>

							<p>
								Liv’s heart dropped. If she’d waited just one week to meet themoneylenders, she’d have
								drawn one more installment of her allowance,and she’d have ample money to help out her
								friend. “I just paid off a debt,Vena. I’ve got nothing left. It cost me everything.”
							</p>

							<p>
								Vena wilted.“Wait, we could sell some of my dresses. If you can wait until morning—”“No,
								forget it. They’ll be looking for me by then. And they know you’remy only friend.
								They’ll be watching you. It was a stupid idea. I need to goface this.”
							</p>

							<p>
								A knock on the door. “Miss?” a man’s voice called out.Vena opened the door and four men
								in slaves’ clothes came in andpicked up the trunks. Vena picked up her own bag. “Walk me
								to the docks?”she asked Liv, putting on a brave face.
							</p>

							<p>
								Still horrified, disbelieving, Liv nodded.They walked slowly, as if they could postpone
								the inevitable forever.“This really is a great place,” Vena said, as they crossed the
								bridge forthe last time together. “It’s a marvel. And I was here. For a while. My
								fatherwas a servant; my mother was a servant. There’s nothing wrong with goinghome and
								serving. I’m not better than they are. And you know what? I metthe Prism!” Her eyes were
								gleaming. “He called me marvelous! Hecomplimented my dress. Me. He noticed me, Liv, with
								all those beautifulgirls there. No one can take that away from me. How many
								people—howmany drafters never get that much in their whole lives? The Prism himself!”
							</p>

							<p>
								Her bravery made Liv tear up. She studiously avoided looking at Vena,sure she’d lose
								control if she did.
							</p>

							<p>
								But all too soon, they were at the docks. They said their goodbyestearfully, promising
								to write, Liv promising that she would use anyconnections she could make to get Vena
								reinstated. Vena smiled sadly,resigned.“Come on, ladies,” the captain said. “Time and
								the tide wait for no man,nor for blubbering girls, neither.”
							</p>

							<p>
								Liv hugged Vena one more time and left. She’d barely stepped off thewood of the dock
								when she saw a familiar figure lurking in the shadowslike a spider. Aglaia
								Crassos.“You!” Liv said. “This is your work!”Aglaia smiled. “I wonder, Liv, do you think
								we owe a debt to ourfriends? A debt of love, or duty?”“Of course we do.”“But apparently
								your duty to your friend isn’t as important as your needto defy me.”“You bitch,” Liv
								said, quivering.“I’m not the one who’s letting her friend pay for my pride. It can stop,
							</p>

							<p>
								Liv, or it can get worse.”“You still want me to spy on the Prism.”“Vena’s not going
								home, just so you know. I own her contract already.
							</p>

							<p>
								And I’ve got a deal with a rather… dubious Ilytian. He’s willing to give mea good price
								for Vena. Most people have scruples about selling drafters. Ofcourse, she’s not a full
								drafter, so she won’t be entitled to any of a drafter’snormal privileges. But, hey, Vena
								loves sailing, right? Not many women onthe galleys. They don’t usually last very long,
								nor do the other slaves treatthem well, so owners usually put women to other work. But I
								can arrangeit.”
							</p>

							<p>
								Not just a slave. A galley slave. The worst of the worst. Liv wanted tovomit. She wanted
								to murder Aglaia. Orholam save her.“Or…” Aglaia said, “you give me the word.” She nodded
								toward amessenger standing across the street. “And he runs to the captain with amessage,
								saying it’s all a mistake, Vena’s been reinstated, and so forth.Wonder of wonders. You
								are my own special project, Liv. You have my fullattention.”
							</p>

							<p>
								Liv looked at the boat, despairing. It was true. She had no friends, nooptions, no
								choices. How could she fight Aglaia Crassos, with all herwealth and power? If she asked
								the Prism for help, he’d ask questions. He’dthink she’d been spying all along. Every
								part of the Chromeria and thesatrapies was corrupt; they were all turned against
								her.“Hurry, Liv, the tide’s turning,” Aglaia said.There was no way out, no time to try
								to come up with a third way.
							</p>

							<p>
								Maybe her father would have said no and spat in Aglaia’s ugly face andheld on to his
								honor. Liv wasn’t that strong. The sharks and sea demons hadher. “Fine,” she said, her
								heart failing within her. “You win. What do I haveto do?”
							</p>

							<p>
								Chapter 49
							</p>

							<p>
								Gavin hadn’t even gotten fully out of his father’s apartments when he sawtrouble coming.
								His mother’s apartments were right beside his father’s, andthere was no way he could
								leave without passing in front of her doors—andher doors were open.
							</p>

							<p>
								Every time. Every burning time. If his father’s windows hadn’t all beenbolted shut and
								covered with layers of fabric, Gavin would have jumped outof a window. In fact, it was
								just during one of these sorts of situations thathe’d first drafted a bonnet. Every time
								he came back from even the shortesttrip, it seemed he spent all day meeting with one
								important person afteranother. All he did was meet with people—and every one of them
								haddemands of him.
							</p>

							<p>
								Nonetheless, Gavin turned in as he went past his mother’s open doors.
							</p>

							<p>
								The room slave was a young Tyrean girl, judging from her dark eyes andhair and
								kopi-colored skin. Gavin motioned to her as he passed that shecould close the doors
								behind him. His mother had a talent for trainingslaves: even a girl barely in her teens
								like this one would wait attentivelyand respond to the smallest signal. Of course, Gavin
								wasn’t so muchdifferent, was he?“Mother,” Gavin said. She stood as he came close. He
								kissed her many-ringed fingers, and she laughed and embraced him, as she always did.“My
								son,” she said. Felia Guile was a handsome woman in her earlyfifties. She had been a
								cousin of the Atashian royal family, and in her youththe Atashian noble families rarely
								married foreigners. Andross Guile, ofcourse, had been a special case. He always was. She
								had the classic, strikingAtashian pairing of olive skin and cornflower blue eyes, though
								her blueeyes bore a wide halo of dull orange around the iris. She had been anorange
								drafter—though she wasn’t greatly talented, Andross would neverhave married a woman who
								couldn’t draft. Slim despite her age, Felia wasregal, fashionable, comfortable in
								herself, commanding without beingdomineering, beautiful, and warm.
							</p>

							<p>
								He had no idea how she could stand being married to his father.She flicked two fingers
								of her left hand, dismissing the room slavewithout taking her eyes off Gavin. “So, I
								hear a rumor that you have a…nephew.”
							</p>

							<p>
								Gavin cleared his throat. How fast did word travel in this place,anyway? He looked
								around the room. The slave was gone. “That’s correct.”“A natural son,” Felia Guile said,
								her lips pulling taut momentarily. Shewould never say “bastard.” With her huge palette
								of facial expressions, shedidn’t have to. Over the years, orange had made her both more
								empatheticand more suspicious. With her natural intuition and intelligence, it made
								herquite formidable.“That’s right. He’s a good young man. His name’s Kip.”“Fifteen years
								old?” She didn’t say, So you cheated on your fiancée,whom I’ve been urging you to marry
								for the last sixteen years. Felia lovedKarris. Andross Guile had been dead set against
								Gavin marrying a womanwhose family had nothing, like Karris’s, after the war. It was one
								of the fewareas where Gavin’s mother had continued to defy his father. Usually whenthey
								disagreed, she would let her objections be known with force andeloquence, and then
								concede to whatever Andross decided. Not a few times,Gavin had seen Andross change his
								mind after his mother so artfullysurrendered. The disagreement over Karris White Oak,
								however, hadinvolved screaming, shattered porcelain, and tears. Gavin thoughtsometimes
								that if he hadn’t been present during that fight, Andross wouldhave given in, but the
								man couldn’t lose face in front of anyone, much lesshis boundary-pushing son.“He is,”
								Gavin said.Felia folded her hands and studied his face. “So, is his existence asmuch of
								a surprise to you as it is to everyone else, or more?”
							</p>

							<p>
								A shiver shot down Gavin’s spine. His mother was no fool. She was ascareful to guard
								against eavesdroppers as anyone, but she had ways ofgetting to exactly what she meant.
								After Sundered Rock, when Gavin hadstaggered alone out of the magical conflagration,
								wearing his brother’sclothing and his brother’s crown and his brother’s scars under
								layers of sootand blood, everyone else had taken him to be Gavin unquestioningly.Despite
								the age difference, the brothers had been mistaken for twins dozensof times, and their
								mannerisms were uncannily similar. And Gavin had beencareful to emulate his brother’s
								idiosyncrasies of vocabulary andexpression. Any differences that had emerged after the
								war ended had beenwritten off as Gavin having been changed by having to kill his own
								brother.
							</p>

							<p>
								But Gavin woke the morning of his first night back at the Chromeria tofind his mother
								sitting on the foot of his bed. Her eyes were red and puffyfrom weeping, though her
								cheeks were dry. She’d been careful to do herweeping before he woke.“Did you think I
								wouldn’t know my own boy?” she had asked. “You’rethe blood of my blood. Did you think
								you could deceive even me?”“I didn’t think it would work this long, mother. I expected
								any of ahundred people to see through this farce, but what else can I do?”“I understand
								why you’ve done what you’ve done,” she said. “I just hadbraced myself against your
								death, not your brother’s, and now to see you…It’s like having to choose which of my
								remaining sons I’d prefer to die.”“No one’s asking that of you.”“Just tell me this,” she
								said. “Is Gavin dead?”“Yes,” he’d said. “I didn’t want… He gave me no… I’m sorry.”Her
								eyes had streamed tears, but she ignored them. “What do you need,
							</p>

							<p>
								Dazen? I’ve lost both of your brothers; I swear to Orholam I won’t loseyou.”“Tell them
								I’m convalescing. Tell them the battle nearly killed me.
							</p>

							<p>
								When the time is right, tell them it changed me. But don’t make me lookweak.”
							</p>

							<p>
								And so she’d become his only true ally in the Chromeria. And after sheleft, he’d barred
								the door and opened the chest where his drugged brotherlay, not a foot from where their
								mother had stood. He studied theunconscious figure minutely, and then himself in a
								mirror. Taking note ofevery difference, he set to work. His brother’s hair had a cowlick
								that stuckout whenever he cut it short; the new Gavin would have to wear his hairlong so
								no one noticed this disparity. Gavin was a little shorter than Dazen,and had liked to
								wear boots with more heel; the new Gavin would wearflatter shoes. He began writing lists
								of his brother’s mannerisms, the wayGavin liked to pop his neck to the left and right.
								Or was it right and left?
							</p>

							<p>
								Damn it, Dazen didn’t even know how to pop his neck. Gavin liked toshave every day, even
								twice a day, to keep his face smooth; Dazen hadshaved a few times a week, finding it too
								much bother. Gavin always worea particular scent; Dazen had never bothered. He’d have to
								send a servant tofetch it. Gavin cared about his clothing and made sure he was at
								theforefront of every trend; Dazen didn’t even know how he did that. He’dneed to look
								into it. Had Gavin plucked his eyebrows? Dear Orholam.
							</p>

							<p>
								Other changes were harder to make. Dazen had a mole on the inside ofone elbow.
								Grimacing, he sliced it off. It would become a little scar. No onewould notice.
							</p>

							<p>
								His mother helped, coming every day, handkerchief in hand for hersilent tears, but back
								ramrod straight. She pointed out quirks Dazen neverwould have remembered, like the way
								his brother stood when he wasthinking, and what foods Gavin loved and what he hated.
							</p>

							<p>
								But the biggest reason for his success had been the real Gavin himself.
							</p>

							<p>
								Gavin had painted Dazen as a False Prism. He’d sworn that Dazen deceivedhis retainers
								with parlor tricks that would never convince anyone whowasn’t criminal or insane or who
								stood to benefit by standing with a FalsePrism. Everyone knew there was only ever one
								Prism every generation, sothey’d believed the old Gavin implicitly. So from their first
								glance atDazen’s prismatic eyes, they knew he was Gavin. Those who knew better,who knew
								that Dazen had never needed parlor tricks, who knew he was asmuch a Prism as Gavin—in
								other words, Dazen’s closest retainers andfriends—had been scattered to the four winds
								after the Battle of SunderedRock. He’d betrayed them, and if it was a betrayal for the
								greater good, itstill kept him up nights to know that Ilytian pirates were selling his
								peoplefor slaves in a hundred ports. He drew up his first list of seven greatpurposes,
								and he did what he could.
							</p>

							<p>
								And through it all, his mother had saved him a dozen times. Shedeserved the
								truth.“More,” he told her now. It was more of a surprise to him than to anyonethat he
								had a son. He and his men had been living in caves and on the run,and even if he’d had
								the energy for entertaining some of the campfollowers, he’d been heartsick over Karris’s
								engagement to Gavin. Dazenhadn’t slept with anyone during the war.
							</p>

							<p>
								She stood and walked to the door, opened it to see that no one waseavesdropping, and
								returned. Quietly, she said, “So you’ve adopted yourbrother’s natural son. Why?”
							</p>

							<p>
								Because you’re always bothering me about giving you a grandson, healmost said, but he
								knew that would wound her. Because it’s the right thingto do? Because Gavin would have?
								No, he wasn’t sure that Gavin wouldhave. Because the boy had nothing and he deserved a
								chance? BecauseKarris was there watching and there was something perversely
								pleasurableabout wounding her by doing what was right? “Because I know what it’slike to
								be alone,” Gavin said. He was surprised that it was the truth.“You don’t give Karris
								enough credit,” his mother said.“What’s she got to do with anything?”His mother just
								shook her head. “She didn’t take it well?”“You might say that,” Gavin said.“What are you
								going to do if your father refuses to recognize the boy?”“He’s not moving me on this,
								mother. I don’t do very many things thatare right. He’s not taking this one away.”
							</p>

							<p>
								She smiled suddenly. “Did it make your list of seven purposes this time?
							</p>

							<p>
								Defying him?”“My list only has things that are possible.”“So it’s harder than stopping
								the Blood War? Harder than destroying thepirate lords?”“Twice,” Gavin said. “And
								yes.”“You get that from him, you know.”“What?”“Your father always made lists, goals to
								check off. Marry a girl from theright family by twenty-five, join the Spectrum by
								forty—he made it bythirty-five—and so on. Of course, he never had to organize his life
								in seven-year blocks.”“Did he never want to be Prism himself?” Gavin asked.She didn’t
								answer right away. “Prisms usually only last seven years.”Not long enough for my father.
								I see. “He wanted more sons anddaughters, didn’t he?” Even after Sevastian. More tools.
								More weapons, incase more went bad.
							</p>

							<p>
								She said nothing. “I want to go home, Gavin. I’ve wanted to join the
							</p>

							<p>
								Freeing for years. I’m so tired.”
							</p>

							<p>
								For a moment, Gavin couldn’t breathe. His mother was the veryquintessence of life.
								Beauty, energy, cleverness, good nature. To hear herspeak as if she were broken down, as
								if she wanted to quit, was like a blowto the stomach.“Of course, your father will never
								allow it,” she said, smiling sadly. “Butwhether he allows it or not, sometime in these
								next five years, I’m joining.I’ve buried two sons. I will not bury you.” So she was just
								giving himwarning, giving him time to prepare. Dear Orholam, he didn’t even want tothink
								about it. His mother had been his only companion, his best adviser,the one person who
								sniffed out threats from leagues away and loved him nomatter what.“So, what were your
								seven purposes? Accomplished any of them yet?”she asked, bringing the conversation back
								to safe ground, even though sheknew he would dodge.“I learned to fly. Took me most of
								the last year.”She looked at him like she couldn’t tell for once whether he was
								joking.“That could prove handy,” she said carefully.
							</p>

							<p>
								Gavin laughed.“You’re serious,” she said.“I’ll have to take you for a ride—a
								flight?—sometime,” Gavin said.“You’ll love it.”“And you think the idea of that is a good
								enough distraction to sidetrackme from getting the rest of your goals out of
								you?”“Absolutely,” Gavin said, in mock seriousness. “I learned from thebest.”“Very
								well,” she said. “Now get out of here.” He was halfway out thedoor when she called.
								“Gavin!” She called him Gavin now, always, evenwhen her eyes called him Dazen. “Be
								careful. You know how your father iswhen someone won’t do what he wills.”
							</p>

								Chapter 50
							</p>

							<p>
								Kip woke with a dead arm from a dream about his mother holding his headin her lap. It
								wasn’t a dream; it was half memory. He’d been young. Hismother was running her fingers
								through his hair, her eyes red, swollen. Redeyes usually meant she’d been smoking haze,
								but this morning she didn’tsmell of smoke or alcohol. I’m sorry, she said, I’m so sorry.
								I’ve quit. It’sgoing to be different from now on. I promise.
							</p>

							<p>
								He cracked open one sleep-snot-encrusted eye and moaned. That’s nice,mother, can you
								just get off my arm? He rolled over. He’d slept on theground? On a carpet? Oh! As the
								blood slowly flooded back into his arm, itstarted hurting. He rubbed it until feeling
								returned. Where was he? Oh,Liv’s room. It was barely dawn.
							</p>

							<p>
								Sitting up, Kip saw a woman coming in the room. Maybe the openingdoor had woken him. Liv
								must have slept elsewhere. The covers of the bedweren’t even disturbed.“Good morning,
								Kip,” the woman said. She was a dark woman, withheavy eyebrows, frizzy hair, and a
								flamboyant gold scarf around her neck.She was thick, hugely tall, with great heavy
								shoulders and a bold-patternedgreen dress draped over her like a sheet over a galleass.
								“It’s dawn, andtime for your first lesson. I’m Mistress Helel.”“You’re my magister?” Kip
								said, still rubbing his hurting arm.“Oh yes.” She smiled, but the smile didn’t touch her
								eyes. “And you’llremember today’s lesson for the rest of your life. Get up, Kip.”
							</p>

							<p>
								Kip stood. She walked past him and opened a door to a small balconyoutside Liv’s
								room.“Come quickly,” she said. “You need to see this before the sun is fullyover the
								horizon.”
							</p>

							<p>
								Hair squashed, mouth full of cotton, breath foul, arm throbbing, Kiplicked his dry lips
								and stepped past Mistress Helel. Her eyes were dark andintense—so dark that he couldn’t
								even tell what color of a drafter she was.
							</p>

							<p>
								Weird. Here I’m supposed to see minute differentiations in colorsundetectable to most
								people, and I couldn’t even see the color in her irises.He stepped onto the pure yellow
								luxin balcony. Aside from streaks of wateror dirt, the entire thing was eerily clear.
							</p>

							<p>
								Despite his experience yesterday learning that the yellow was one of thestrongest
								materials known, Kip tested his weight on the balcony gingerly. Itwas, of course, solid.
								Due to the way the towers all leaned out, as ifblossoming, if Kip fell from here, he’d
								smash on the rocks several hundredfeet below, just shy of the water. It was even worse
								for the floors abovethem, which leaned even farther out. He gulped and tried to pay
								attention tothe rising sun.“We don’t have all day, Kip,” Mistress Helel said. There was
								somethingin her voice, a tension.
							</p>

							<p>
								Kip turned as she stepped out onto the balcony with him. At first hethought she was
								tripping, because she lunged forward so suddenly. Hemoved toward her to catch her. If
								there was one thing good about being fat,it was that he could stop big weights.
							</p>

							<p>
								But Mistress Helel extended both of her hands like battering rams. Kip’smove forward
								brought him between her arms. Her thumbs scratched acrosshis chest and off both sides.
								She cursed as they crushed together in anawkward hug.“I’ve got you,” Kip said. “Don’t
								worry, you’re not going to—”The big woman stood to her full height, regaining her
								balance. She wasmuch taller than Kip, and the move pressed big flat breasts onto either
								sideof his face. Somehow his chin got caught in her dress’s gaping neckline asshe stood
								and for a brief—but not nearly brief enough—moment, Kip’s facewas fully engulfed in
								flabby cleavage.“Gah!” Kip blurted.Mistress Helel was already bending over, mercifully
								freeing her necklineof Kip’s chin, but then bending farther, her body pressing against
								his. Afteran experience that he was doubtless going to relive in dreams—and not thegood
								kind—he sidled out of the way.
							</p>

							<p>
								The woman’s big meaty hands slapped on Kip’s right and left legs. Hismove to the side
								made her left hand slip off his right leg, though. Then shelifted.“What are you—” Kip
								stopped as soon as he saw her eyes.Dead concentration, complete lack of emotion. She
								pushed forward hardinto Kip, lifting. He put it all together far too slowly.
							</p>

							<p>
								The intensity, the story, the lack of color in her eyes, the stumble thathadn’t been a
								stumble. It had been a lunge. The lack of embarrassment atKip being pressed against her
								breasts—because you don’t let the touch of alittle flesh deter you. Not when you’ve come
								to kill.
							</p>

							<p>
								Kip’s hands slapped against the edge of the balcony behind him. Withonly one leg in her
								hands, Mistress Helel lifted sharply. She was so strongthat Kip’s weight was no problem
								for her.
							</p>

							<p>
								If he’d been a brave man, Kip would have fought her. If he’d beenflexible, he would let
								her pick up the one leg while he stood on the otherand beat her to a bloody pulp.
								Instead, Kip took the fatty’s way. He wentlimp, floppy, making all his weight dead
								weight, seeking the ground theway he’d done when Ram would try to show off by picking
								him up andthrowing him on the ground. If Kip collapsed, Ram could never lift him,where
								if he held himself rigid, Ram could hold his weight easily.
							</p>

							<p>
								Mistress Helel brought one hand off Kip’s left leg, seeking a gripanywhere on his round
								body. Kip wriggled like a fish, pushing off thebalcony, trying to push himself back into
								the tower. She pinned him againstthe corner of the balcony with her own substantial
								weight and drew backher left hand to punch him.
							</p>

							<p>
								But the floor called him, and without her strong arm to hold him, Kipanswered. Her fist
								descended and landed a glancing blow, but Kip fell. Shelost her hold and he went turtle,
								barely keeping a grip on his pant leg.Cursing, she tried to lift him by that alone.
							</p>

							<p>
								His pants ripped, and then slipped off his waist. They tangled around hisknees, but
								however his baggy pants hampered his movements, they didnothing to help the assassin
								lift him either. She cursed him and punched hisleg, taking a wide stance to pound him.
								He yelped. Then she slugged him inthe stomach, taking his breath away. She snarled.
								“Take your death like aman.”
							</p>

							<p>
								Kip bit her ankle.
							</p>

							<p>
								The assassin cried out and fell on top of him. She recovered enough toland knee-first on
								his chest. Then she angled her fall so she crushed andtrapped him. Apparently Kip wasn’t
								the only one who knew how to use hisweight to good advantage. She landed with her head
								toward his feet.
							</p>

							<p>
								She trapped one of Kip’s legs in one iron hand. Then she punched histhigh. She caught it
								dead center. It was like being kicked by a horse. Hescreamed. Then she grabbed his other
								leg. No amount of thrashing couldbreak her grip. It was hard to even breathe with her on
								top of him, her legscrushing his face. She pummeled his other leg, and it too went dead.
								Shepushed herself up and punched him in the groin.
							</p>

							<p>
								Stars flashed in front of Kip’s eyes. Any thought of counterattack fled.
							</p>

							<p>
								He just wanted to curl into a ball. Her weight shifted, crushing him again,and then she
								stood. She had one of his ankles in each of her hands, and shelifted him easily. She was
								going to toss him over the balcony, dear Orholam.There was nothing he could do to stop
								it.
							</p>

							<p>
								Eyes squinted in pain, weakly thrashing, Kip saw a thin beam ofsuperviolet luxin stick
								to the assassin’s head.“Stop it! Drop him now!” a young woman screamed from inside
								theroom. Liv?
							</p>

							<p>
								The assassin snarled a curse and turned toward Liv just as a yellow luxinball blasted
								from her hands, zipped along the superviolet line, and explodedin a blinding flash
								against the assassin’s face. Mistress Helel dropped Kip,lifting a hand to protect
								herself too late, and staggered backward.
							</p>

							<p>
								She was so tall that the rail of the balcony caught her below the waist.
							</p>

							<p>
								She hit it hard and tottered. Her meaty hands slapped onto the rail as shewent on
								tiptoe, feet seeking purchase. Kip, lying on the ground, slid a handunder her foot and
								lifted. Not hard—he was in so much pain he could barelymove—but it was enough.
							</p>

							<p>
								The assassin felt herself going over the edge and scrambled. She fell—and caught herself
								on the rail of the balcony. Through the clear yellow ofthe balcony, she swung
								face-to-face with Kip. Each balcony had a small gapfor rainwater to sluice off so it
								wouldn’t fill with water, and the bigwoman’s face was barely a foot from Kip’s own.
							</p>

							<p>
								Kip looked at her. He knew how this ended. Some skinny woman mightbe able to pull her
								weight up, but not a woman this size. Kip was strong—he could lift heavier things than
								Sanson or even Ram—but when you werereally big, heaving your entire weight over a ledge
								was impossible. And thiswoman was much bigger than he was. Mistress Helel heaved, and
								for oneterrifying moment Kip thought he was wrong. Her elbows bent and herbody lifted.
								She swung one heavy leg to the side, trying to reach it highenough to reach the rain-gap
								in the balcony.
							</p>

							<p>
								Then her strength gave out and she swung back to vertical. She wasfinished. Kip could
								see it in her eyes. “Light cannot be chained, LittleGuile,” she said. “Anat blind you.
								Mot smite you to the tenth generation.Belphegor blight your sons. Atirat spit on your
								mother’s grave. Ferriluxcorrupt your father’s—”
							</p>

							<p>
								Kip punched her through the rain-gap. Her nose crunched in a spray ofblood. She must
								have been expecting the blow, because she tried to snag hisfist—but missed.
							</p>

							<p>
								She fell, flailing all the way, screaming something, but Kip couldn’tmake out the words.
								She slammed into a sharp boulder not five paces fromthe crashing waves of the Cerulean
								Sea, and her body actually burstasunder, a piece—a leg?—shearing off and flying to
								splash into the water asthe rest of her crunched in one long bloody smudge.
							</p>

							<p>
								It didn’t seem real. Part of Kip knew that could have been him, maybeshould have been
								him, but he was suddenly aware of Liv standing justinside her apartments. “Kip, Kip, we
								killed her,” Liv was saying. Kip wasmore aware that his balls were aching and he was
								pretty much naked infront of the only girl he knew, and he was fat and gross and should
								coverhimself immediately.
							</p>

							<p>
								He’d barely hiked up his pants by the time Liv lurched to the balconyrail and vomited.
								Kip hated throwing up. He hated himself throwing up, andhe hated other people throwing
								up. But worst, he discovered, as the windblew across the yellow tower and carried mist
								through the rain-gap, Kiphated being thrown up on. Little misty wetness stuck to his
								face and in hisopen mouth.
							</p>

							<p>
								He rolled over, spitting and coughing and slapping at his own face towipe off puke-mist.
								He rolled to his feet, balls still aching, face scrunched.“Oh no,” Liv said, her face
								gray and mortified, realizing she’d thrownup on him. She looked from him, to his crotch
								where his pants were torn,and then to the rocks so far below. She struggled for words
								and found none.“You know, I’m glad things aren’t awkward between us,” Kip said. Did
								Ireally just say that? It was like part of him couldn’t help being totallyinappropriate.
								He’d just killed someone, and he was so terrified and painedand embarrassed and
								mortified and thankful to be alive and he didn’t evenknow what all else, he couldn’t
								help himself.
							</p>

							<p>
								Liv’s mouth twitched up for half a moment, and then she leaned backover the rail and
								vomited again.
							</p>

							<p>
								Always something to say, never the right thing. Well done, Kip.
							</p>

							<p>
								Chapter 51“Midsummer is coming,” the White said. “Sun Day.”
							</p>

							<p>
								Gavin stood in front of her on the top of the Chromeria. Together, theywere waiting for
								the sun to rise. Midsummer, as far as Gavin wasconcerned, was always coming.“I’ve
								started preparations for the Freeing,” she said. “Do you think yourfather will commune
								this year?”
							</p>

							<p>
								Gavin snorted. “Not this year. Not ever.” He rubbed his temples. Hehadn’t slept.“It’s
								not natural,” the White said quietly. “I used to marvel at his self-control, you know.
								Living in that awful room, keeping his mind sharp,keeping the nightmares at
								bay.”“Nightmares have to keep him at bay.”“I live half in darkness, Gavin,” the White
								said as if he hadn’tinterrupted. “That’s how it feels to live without drafting. But to
								live fully indarkness? Is that not a denial of Orholam himself? ‘They love the
								darkness,for their deeds are dark, and the light shames them.’ ”“I leave the state of my
								father’s soul to my father. Are we not to honorour fathers, rendering obedience unto the
								authority the Father of All hasentrusted to them?”“You’re not just a son, Gavin. You’re
								the Prism. You should honor
							</p>

							<p>
								Orholam by practicing the authority he’s given you, not just the power.”“Maybe it’s time
								for you to be Freed,” Gavin said bitterly. He had theseconversations at least once a
								year. He was sick of it. The White asked afterhis father, his father suggested the White
								go first. Both pressured him topressure the other.
							</p>

							<p>
								The White held her hands out, palms up. “If you command it, my Prism,
							</p>

							<p>
								I will join the Freeing. Gladly.”
							</p>

							<p>
								Her words stopped him cold. She meant it.“I also obey,” the White said. “It might
								surprise you to learn it, Gavin,but I drew the straw to become the White before I began
								to understand whatit was to even be a drafter, much less a Color, much less the White.
								Butperhaps it is not a lesson that can be taught, only learned.”“What are you talking
								about?” Gavin asked.“Do you know why faith is harder for us, my Lord Prism?” The
								Whitegrinned. Sometimes despite her years, she seemed a mischievous girl.“Because we
								know Orholam sleeps a hundred years for every day hewakes?” Gavin asked. He was tired,
								and not just from the insomnia.
							</p>

							<p>
								She refused the bait. “Because we know ourselves. Because others obeyus as though we
								were gods, and we know we’re not. We see the fragility ofour own power, and through it
								we see the fragility of every other link. Whatif the Spectrum suddenly refused my
								orders? Not hard to imagine, whenyou consider the scheming and lust for power it takes
								to become a Color.What if a general suddenly refuses his satrap’s orders? What if a son
								refuseshis father’s orders? What if that first link in the Great Chain of being—Orholam
								Himself—is as empty as every other link before him? Seeing theweakness of each link, we
								think the Great Chain itself is fragile: surely atany moment it will burst if we don’t
								do everything in our power to hold ittogether.”
							</p>

							<p>
								Gavin swallowed involuntarily. He’d never really universalized thethought as she was
								doing, but he always thought his whole life was likethat. His deceptions, his authority,
								his imprisoned brother, his relationships.A chain of wet paper, drooping under its own
								sodden weight. A chain towhich he added new weight every day.“Here’s what I’ve learned,”
								the White said. “Orholam doesn’t need me.
							</p>

							<p>
								Oh, I can do good work for him, work that pleases him, and if I foul it,others will
								suffer. You see, what I do still matters, but in the end, Orholam’swill prevails. So I
								think I still have work to do. I see unfinished businesseverywhere I look. But if you
								tell me that I should be Freed thisMidsummer’s, I will do so gladly, not because I have
								faith in you, Gavin—though I do, more than you know—but because I have faith in
								Orholam.”
							</p>

							<p>
								Gavin looked at her like she was a visitor from the moon. “That wasvery… metaphysical.
								Can we talk about the Freeing now?”
							</p>

							<p>
								She laughed. “Here’s the thing, Gavin. You remember everything. Iknow you do. You think
								I’m crazy now, but you’ll remember this, andsomeday it might make a difference. And with
								that, I can be content.”
							</p>

							<p>
								Madwoman or saint—but then, Gavin didn’t think there was anydifference.“I’m going to
								Garriston,” he said.She folded her hands in her lap and turned toward the rising
								light.“Let me explain,” Gavin rushed to say. Then he did, ignoring the beautyof the
								sunrise. Ten minutes later, he was almost finished when the Whiteraised a finger. She
								held her breath, then sighed as the sun itself masteredthe horizon. “Do you ever watch
								for the green flash?”“Sometimes,” Gavin said. He knew people who swore they’d seen
								it,though no one could explain what it was or why it happened, and he knewothers who
								swore it was a myth.“I think of it as Orholam’s wink,” the White said.Is everything
								about Orholam with her? Maybe she is fading.“You’ve seen it?” Gavin asked.“Twice. The
								first time was… fifty-nine years ago now? No, sixty. It wasthe night I met Ulbear.”
								Gavin had to reach to remember the name. Oh,Ulbear Rathcore, the White’s husband and
								quite a famous man in his day.Dead now twenty years. “I was at a party, quite disgusted
								with the drunkyoung gentleman who’d escorted me there and most certainly wasn’t goingto
								be escorting me home. I went outside to get some air. Watched the sunset, saw the green
								flash, and was so excited I jumped. Unfortunately thisvery tall fellow was leaning over
								me to grab his wineglass that he’d left onthe balcony, and I broke his nose with the
								back of my head.”“You met Ulbear Rathcore by breaking his nose?”“The woman he was
								escorting that night was none too pleased. She wasbeautiful, graceful, prettier than I
								was by half, and somehow she couldn’tcompete with little clumsy me. Though I can’t
								imagine she would havebeen happy if she’d married Ulbear, your grandmother didn’t
								forgive me fortwo years.”“My grandmother?”“If I hadn’t seen the green flash at that
								instant, your grandmother wouldhave married Ulbear, and you wouldn’t be here now,
								Gavin.” The Whitelaughed. “See, you never know what you’ll learn when you let old
								womenprattle.”
							</p>

							<p>
								Gavin was left speechless.“You can go to Garriston, of course, Gavin, but no one else
								can performthe Freeing, and it can be done at no other time. So there’s only one
								option:I’ll send all those to be Freed to Garriston. I’ll have to send our fastest
								shipsto intercept theirs so they can arrive in time.”“We’re talking about war,” Gavin
								said.“And?”“What do you mean ‘and’?” he demanded. “I’m not going to have timeto throw
								parties and set off fireworks and give speeches.”“The list I have so far is only perhaps
								a hundred and fifty drafters. Not alarge flight this year. A good proportion of those
								definitely won’t make it tonext year. You want another eighty or ninety color
								wights?”“Of course not.”“The parties are nice, Gavin, but understand what you are. This
								is theflip side of your first purpose.” She’d figured out that he’d sworn to wipeout
								color wights because of Sevastian. Like everything she learned, sheused it to control
								him. “Even if you don’t believe the Prism is Orholam’sgift to mankind, they do. The
								minutes each drafter spends with you beingFreed are the holiest moments of her life. You
								can take that away, but itwould be the worst thing you could do. I for one can forgive
								you much, butI’d never forgive you that.”
							</p>

							<p>
								That stung.“Now, tell me how you dropped off Karris in Tyrea, killed a giist, andbrought
								back a son, all within a few days. The trip alone should have takenyou two weeks.”
							</p>

							<p>
								Well that was quick. He’d known she would learn of the skimmer andthe condor as soon as
								he’d shown Karris, but he hadn’t been able to stophimself. Maybe he was impulsive. So he
								told her about the skimmer and thecondor. Her eyes lit up. “That would be something to
								see, Gavin. Flying!And the speed! I suppose you’ll want to go back to Garriston the
								sameway?”“Yes, and I’m taking Kip with me.”Again she surprised him and didn’t protest.
								“Good,” she said. “It will begood for you to learn about a father’s love.”
							</p>

							<p>
								Because I sure as the evernight didn’t learn about that from my ownfather. Then Gavin
								realized that was exactly what she meant, and hebristled. But there was no point
								fighting over his father again.“So what was the second time?” he asked instead.“Second
								time?”“The second time you saw the green flash. The second time Orholamwinked.” He kept
								the sarcasm out of his voice. Mostly.
							</p>

							<p>
								She smiled. “I look forward to the day when I tell you that, my Lord
							</p>

							<p>
								Prism, but that day is not today.” Then her smile passed. “When you return,we need to
								talk about Kip’s testing.”“You noticed the wall crystals. I thought I stopped it in
								time.”“Old? Yes. Addled? Not yet.”“You want to hear me admit it? Kip nearly broke the
								test,” Gavin said.“Like Dazen did.”“Or worse, passed it,” the White said.
							</p>

								Chapter 52
							</p>

							<p>
								Karris knew she was even deeper in trouble than she’d feared within fiveminutes of being
								captured. King Garadul’s Mirrormen walked her atgunpoint over to a wagon. They didn’t
								bind her hands, which she thoughtwas curious and gave her a momentary hope. Then the
								Mirrormen handedher off to half a dozen drafters, all women. Two Mirrormen stayed,
								theirpistols leveled at her head, barely blinking.
							</p>

							<p>
								The women—two reds, a green, a blue, and a super—stripped her nakedand searched her and
								her clothes, quickly finding her eye caps. The twoMirrormen barely even glanced at her
								body, and though men around thecamp turned to see whatever they could between all the
								drafterssurrounding her, there wasn’t a single ribald comment.
							</p>

							<p>
								Disciplined. Damn it.Crossing her arms over her breasts, Karris looked down,
								feigningembarrassment. Well, maybe not completely feigning.“Eyes up!” one of the reds
								commanded.Karris looked up. They wanted to see her eyes so they would know assoon as she
								tried to draft. Smart too, damn it twice.
							</p>

							<p>
								In rapid order, they went through all her clothing, scrunching everyseam to look for
								hidden pockets. Then they went through her bag, onecarefully cataloguing all the items
								in a codex. After they’d foundeverything, Karris hoped they’d give her back her clothes.
							</p>

							<p>
								No such luck. Instead, they opened the door of the wagon and threw aviolet dress and
								shift inside.“Get in,” the same red who’d spoken before said.
							</p>

							<p>
								Karris got in and the door slammed behind her. She heard a bar beinglowered and chains
								pulled into place. The inside of the wagon was fairlyspacious. There was a pallet to
								sleep on, a chamber pot, a cup of water,several blankets and pillows—all violet, the
								deepest into the blue spectrumthey could find. And from the noxious smell, all freshly
								painted. Thewindows were fitted with bars and violet glass, draped on the outside
								withviolet cloth. Apparently they were taking her drafting seriously, and fromtheir
								study of her eyes and the mag torches, they knew she could draft greenand red. Rather
								than risk a color that was between her colors, they’d pickedthe one farthest to the end
								of the spectrum she didn’t draft.
							</p>

							<p>
								It was a strange kindness. They could have just blindfolded her, ofcourse, but
								blindfolds slip. But most captors would have painted the wagonblack and made her live in
								darkness. This was just as effective, but a lotmore work. If a drafter couldn’t see her
								color, or didn’t have lenses andwhite light, she couldn’t draft. Karris was about as
								close to helpless as shegot. She hated the feeling with a passion.
							</p>

							<p>
								She threw on the slip and the shapeless violet dress, and immediatelyscratched the
								paint. It had been heat-dried by a sub-red. She would be ableto chip it eventually, but
								with the only light coming in through the violetcurtains and violet glass, it wasn’t
								going to matter anyway. Still, she tried.She couldn’t help herself. Under the layer of
								violet paint was a layer ofblack. Under that, the wood was a dark mahogany. No luck.
							</p>

							<p>
								The wagon began rolling within minutes.That night, after she was fed a hunk of black
								bread and given water in ablackened iron cup, two drafters came in, their skin already
								full of red andblue luxin respectively. Behind them came, of all things, a tailor. She
								was atiny woman who barely came up to Karris’s shoulder. She took Karris’smeasurements
								rapidly, never writing them down, just committing them tomemory. Then she stared at
								Karris’s body for a long time, studying her likea farmer studying a rocky sidehill that
								he needed to plow. She double-checked her measurement of Karris’s hips, and then left
								without a word.
							</p>

							<p>
								Over the next five days, Karris learned little. Apparently her wagon wasclose to the
								cooking wagons, because all she heard all day was the rattle ofpots at every bump in the
								road. The shadowy figures of horsemen, maybeMirrormen, sometimes passed close enough to
								her covered windows for herto see their silhouettes. If they spoke, though, she could
								never make out thewords. At night, she was given food in a blackened iron bowl, with
								ablackened iron spoon and black bread and water, never wine—damn them,they even thought
								of the red of wine. A Mirrorman accompanied by adrafter took her chamber pot, bowl,
								spoon, and cup each night after sunset.When she kept the spoon one night, hiding it
								under a pillow, they didn’t saya word. Neither did they give her water the next day.
								When she surrenderedthe spoon, she was given water again.
							</p>

							<p>
								The boredom was the worst. There were only so many push-ups youcould do in a day, and
								anything more strenuous was impossible. There wereno musical instruments, no books, and
								certainly no weapons or drafting topractice.
							</p>

							<p>
								On the sixth night, two blues came in. “Choose a position that’scomfortable,” one of
								them said. Karris sat on her little pallet, hands foldedin her lap, ankles crossed, and
								they bound her arms and legs in about fivetimes the amount of luxin necessary. Then they
								put violet spectacles overher eyes and left.
							</p>

							<p>
								King Garadul entered the wagon, carrying a folding camp chair. Hewore a loose black
								shirt over his shirt, which Karris could barely see, andvoluminous black pants over his
								pants. Karris understood being carefularound her, but this was ridiculous. The king
								settled into the camp chair. Hestared at her wordlessly.“I don’t suppose you remember
								me,” he said. “I met you once, beforethe war. Of course, I was just a boy, three years
								younger than you, and youwere already head over heels for… well, one of the Guile boys,
								I can’tremember which. Maybe you can’t either. There seemed to be someconfusion for a
								time, wasn’t there?”“You’re a real charmer, aren’t you?” Karris asked.“You might be
								surprised,” he said. He shook his head. “I always thoughtyou were a beautiful girl, but
								the stories of you took on a life of their own.A tragic love triangle between the two
								most powerful men in the world sortof demands a beautiful girl, doesn’t it? I mean,
								otherwise, why would twomen tear the world apart? For her insights about history? Her
								wittyrepartee? No. You were a pretty girl made beautiful by the bards’ need tomake some
								sense of what you wrought. Don’t get me wrong,” he said, “Iwas so in love with you it
								kept me up nights. You were my first greatunrequited love.”“I’m sure you’ve had many. Or
								do women pretend to find you attractive,now that you’re king?” Karris asked.
							</p>

							<p>
								Temper, Karris, temper. But the truth was, it wasn’t the red that madeher say that.
								She’d always hated to perform for others, to do just what theywanted.
							</p>

							<p>
								He scowled. “The shrewish tongue somehow was omitted from thepanegyrics. Or is that a
								new addition?”“I feel a bit freer to speak my mind these days. I already destroyed
								theworld, what’s one man’s ego?” Karris said.“Karris, I was on my way to pay you a
								compliment before you made usdescend to this unpleasantness.”“Oh, dear. Please do go on
								then, there’s nothing that would mean moreto me than to hear praises from the Butcher of
								Rekton.”
							</p>

							<p>
								He rubbed his palms together thoughtfully. “I’m sorry you had to seethat, Karris.” He
								kept using her name. She didn’t like it. “I hope you know Itook no joy in what I ordered
								there, but I also hope you understand that thatsmall monstrosity will forestall larger
								ones in the future. You’re familiarwith the manuscript called The Counselor to
								Kings?”“Yes,” Karris said. “Loathsome advice and cruelty that not even he hadthe stomach
								to countenance, when he himself ruled.” The Counselor askedwhether it was better for a
								ruler to be loved or feared. Both was best, hedecided, but if a ruler had to choose, he
								should always choose to be feared.“His advice was good. He was simply personally weak. I
								don’t hold thatagainst him. The fact is, Karris, when kings aren’t feared, they end
								uphaving to instill fear eventually, at grievous prices. That’s what happened atRu.
								That’s what happened at Garriston. Those men you loved—or at leastbedded—learned the
								lesson eventually, but because they learned it late,what they had to do was far worse
								than destroying one little village. So tellme, how can you hold the death of a thousand
								against me, but not the deathof tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands, against them?”
							</p>

							<p>
								Karris hadn’t been allowed to see the royal steps at Ru, stained with theblood and shit
								of hundreds murdered coldly one at a time and thrown downthe steps to the gaping,
								horrified crowds below. She’d been kept from goingto Garriston even after the war, where
								tens of thousands—they didn’t evenknow how many—had perished in the red luxin fires of
								the besieged city.That was Gavin’s and Dazen’s doing. Somehow, it had never
								seemedpossible that men she knew so well would have done such things. Men shethought she
								knew so well.“The people of this land are my people. I am no mere satrap, noguardian of
								some other man’s land; I am king. These people belong to me.To kill a thousand of my own
								was to cut a chunk out of my own flesh. Butcancers have to be cut out. I am this land.
								My people work this land andbring forth crops at my good pleasure. I protect them and
								provide for them,and they in turn must render to me of their crops and of their sons.
								Thosewho would not are rebels, traitors, thieves, and heretics, apostates. Theydefy the
								holy compact. To defy me is to defy the gods’ order. I had to dothis because my father
								wouldn’t. If he had hanged half a dozen mayorswhen they first defied him and refused to
								send levies, that thousand wouldbe alive now. He was weak and wanted to be loved. No one
								mayacknowledge it during my life, but by killing that thousand in Rekton, Isaved many
								more. This is what it is to be a king.”“You’re awfully passionate in your defense of
								decapitating babies andstacking their heads.” The gods’ order, not Orholam’s?“Karris,
								you’re making me understand why men beat their wives.” King
							</p>

							<p>
								Garadul rubbed his black beard, but made no move to strike her. “Bymaking the display so
								awful, I ensured it would be seared into every mindthat saw it. Do you think the dead
								care what happened to their bodies?Better that their example save the living than that I
								bury them all in a holeand my descendants have to kill their descendants. That monument
								will stayfor a dozen generations. That is the legacy I will leave to my
								children’schildren, a secure rule, without the need to commit such massacresthemselves.
								And the reason I tell you, Karris, is that I had hoped you of allpeople might
								understand. You’re a woman now, not some frightened littlegirl surrounded by great men.
								You’re a woman who’s seen great men andterrible deeds. I had hoped you might understand
								the burdens of greatness.At least a little. Perhaps I give you too much credit.”
							</p>

							<p>
								Karris swallowed, trembling with rage and maybe a little fear. There wasa sick logic to
								everything he said, but she had seen the bodies. The blood.The piled-up heads.“As I
								wanted to say earlier,” King Garadul said. He took a deep breath,clearly pushing away
								his frustration, and continued. “You were a very prettygirl, but only pretty, despite
								the tales. But you, to my great delight andsurprise, are one of the few women I’ve ever
								seen who’s gotten morebeautiful as you’ve aged. You look better at thirty than you did
								at twenty,and I wouldn’t be surprised if you look better at forty than you do now.
								Ofcourse, I’m sure it helps that you haven’t squeezed six or ten brats out ofyour
								crotch. Most pretty girls do manage to find a husband before they getso old, but let’s
								not look a gift horse in the mouth.”
							</p>

							<p>
								Real charmer. What was it with King Garadul, did he just say everythingthat popped into
								his idiot head?“Yours is, indeed, a face to inspire poets. This, however”—he gesturedto
								her vaguely, she wasn’t sure what he meant—“this must change. Youhave shoulders like a
								man.” The bastard! How did he know how much shehated her shoulders? Whenever the
								fashions were such that she could hideher shoulders, they showed off her upper arms, or
								vice versa. And he’d saidexactly what she said to herself at least once a week: I have
								shoulders like aman. But the king wasn’t done. “Your ass looks like a ten-year-old
								boy’s.Maybe it’s that dress. We’ll hope so. And your breasts. Your poormagnificent
								breasts. Where have they gone? They were bigger when youwere fifteen! Your training ends
								now. I’ll allow you to resume dancing andriding when you no longer resemble a starved
								Dark Forest pygmy.”“I won’t be here that long,” Karris said. She frowned. Had she
								justadmitted she looked like a starved pygmy?“Karris, my dear. I’ve waited for you for
								fifteen years. And whether ornot you know it, you’ve been waiting for me, too. You and I
								don’t settle forsecond best. Why else would you still be unmarried? So we can wait a
								fewmonths. I’ll come visit you when your dress is done.” He glanced around.“Oh, and I
								noticed you’ve nothing in here to entertain you. It must getboring. It’s good for a
								woman to excel in the pleasant arts. I’ll have mymother’s psantria brought in for you.
								That’s what you play, isn’t it?” Hesmiled and went out.
							</p>

							<p>
								The worst part of it was that Karris did feel thankful. A little. Thebastard.
							</p>

							<p>
								Chapter 53
							</p>

							<p>
								Kip and Liv went straight to the Blackguards watching the lift. “We need tosee the
								Prism,” Liv said.“Who’re you?” the man asked. He was short, Parian of course, and
								builtlike a cornerstone. He looked at Kip. “Oh, are you the Prism’s bas—” Hecoughed.
								“Nephew.”“Yes, I’m his bastard,” Kip said angrily. “We need to see him now.”The
								Blackguard looked over at his compatriot, a man just as muscular,but toweringly tall.
								“We’ve had no orders on how the Prism wants his…nephew treated,” the man said.“He just
								went to sleep not twenty minutes ago,” the other said. “Afterbeing up all night.”“It’s
								an emergency,” Liv said.They seemed unmoved, a little of a who-the-hell-is-this-girl
								creepinginto their faces.“Someone just tried to kill me,” Kip said.“Stump, get the
								commander,” the tall one said. Stump? The short
							</p>

							<p>
								Blackguard’s name was actually Stump? Because the Blackguards wereboth Parian, who
								traditionally had descriptive names like Ironfist, Kip hadno idea if that was a nickname
								or really his name.“He took third watch last night,” Stump said, his mouth
								twisting.“Stump.” Pulling rank.“Awright, awright. I’m going.”Stump left and the taller
								Blackguard turned and rapped on the door,three times, pause, two times. Then, after five
								seconds, he repeated it.
							</p>

							<p>
								A room slave opened the door almost before the Blackguard finishedknocking. A pretty
								woman with the unsettlingly pale skin and red hair of aBlood Forester, she was fully
								dressed and alert despite the early hour andthe darkness of the chamber behind
								her.“Marissia,” Liv said. “So good to see you again.” Her voice didn’t soundtotally
								sincere.
							</p>

							<p>
								The slave appeared none too pleased to see Liv. Kip wondered why Livhad used the slave’s
								name, then. He thought you were only supposed to dothat with slaves with whom you were
								friendly.
							</p>

							<p>
								From deep in the chamber, they heard Gavin’s voice, deep and scratchyfrom just waking,
								“Ummgh, give me a—” Whatever else he said, it was lostin bass and pillows. A moment
								later, all the windows banged open and lightstreamed in from all sides, nearly blinding
								everyone, and eliciting a loudgroan from the Prism on his bed.“That’s brilliant magic!”
								Liv said. “Look at that, Kip!” She pointed at adark purplish-black strip of glass around
								the glass walls that encircled thewhole chamber.“What are you—Are you forgetting why
								we’re here?” Kip asked.“Oh, sorry.”Gavin was squinting at them. “Marissia, kopi,
								please.”The woman bobbed. “First closet, third from the left.” Then she left.“Kopi’s in
								the closet?” Gavin asked. “What the hell? Who puts kopi—and why aren’t you serving me?”
								The door closed behind her. “And where’smy favorite shirt—oh, closet. Damned
								woman.”“Clearly a morning person,” Liv said under her breath.Kip snorted before he could
								stop himself.Gavin had been looking down as if feeling trapped, but now he shot Kipa
								look. “This had better be important.” He threw off his covers and walkedtoward the
								closet. He wasn’t wearing anything.
							</p>

							<p>
								Kip had seen Gavin’s forearms, with hemp ropes for muscles, and he’dknown his father was
								lean, but seeing his whole body was half awe-inspiring and half a slap in the face.
								Kip’s shoulders were as broad asGavin’s, and his arms were probably as big around as
								Gavin’s, but evennow—not after exertion, not filled from hard labor—but now,
								aftersleeping, Gavin’s body was one smooth curving muscle meeting another,over and over,
								without an ounce of softness anywhere. Apparently scullingand skimming around the
								entirety of the Seven Satrapies did that to a man.
							</p>

							<p>
								How did I come from this?Next to him, Kip grew aware of Liv staring, openmouthed. She
								didn’tavert her eyes, even as Gavin had to rummage through the closet.“Liv,” Kip said
								under his breath.“What?” she asked, glancing away, her cheeks bright. “He’s the Prism.
							</p>

							<p>
								It’s practically my religious duty to give him my full attention.”
							</p>

							<p>
								Gavin, who’d seemed oblivious to them, grabbed some clothing andsaid, without looking at
								them, “Ana, staring is rude.”
							</p>

							<p>
								Liv blushed harder and sank into herself, horrified.“Her name’s Liv,” Kip said.“I know
								her name. Now what is it?” Gavin demanded, pulling on adazzling white silk shirt with
								gold piping.
							</p>

							<p>
								The door opened behind Kip, and Marissia and Commander Ironfiststepped into the room.
								Ironfist stopped at the door, while Marissia broughtin a tray with a silver service on
								it and three cups. She poured a dark,creamy, steaming brew into one cup and handed it to
								Gavin, whose pantsand sleeves were still unlaced. “Commander? Kip?” Gavin
								asked,motioning to the other cups. “I think Liv is quite alert enough already.”
							</p>

							<p>
								Liv looked like she wanted to fall through the floor. Kip grinned.Ironfist helped
								himself to the kopi while Marissia took over dressing
							</p>

							<p>
								Gavin. Kip picked up a cup too. But as he picked up the carafe, his handsstarted shaking
								so badly he couldn’t even try to fill his cup.“Someone tried to throw me off the
								balcony,” Kip said.It was like the words made it real. One moment ago, he’d been
								jokingwith Liv, thinking about how unlike his father he was, and grinning whenLiv got
								embarrassed. Now the reality of how close he’d come to gettingthrown to his death came
								crashing in on him. He could see himself falling,twisting, helpless, like in an awful
								dream, and then his body bursting like ajuicy grape.
							</p>

							<p>
								And who would have suspected anything? The woman could haveslipped into his room, thrown
								him off the balcony, and then simply left.Even if they’d figured out who was on the
								floor at the time, who wouldexpect a big woman as an assassin? People would have thought
								Kip hadbroken after his testing and jumped. No one would have known.
							</p>

							<p>
								And who would have cared?Kip felt a great gnawing emptiness in his chest.
							</p>

							<p>
								He’d never been part of anything. Even back in Rekton, he hadn’tbelonged. Too fat and
								awkward for Isa, too smart to feel a connection toSanson, who seemed a whisker away from
								simple, relentlessly mocked byRam, too young for Liv. He’d thought that being part of
								the Chromeriawould make him be part of something for the first time in his life. He
								wasgoing to be different here, too. He would be different and alone, no matterwhere he
								went.
							</p>

							<p>
								Orholam, why had he even stopped that woman from throwing himover? Two moments of
								terror, sure, and a mess of exploded Kip on therocks. But the terror would end,
								everything would end, and the sea wouldwash away the mess.
							</p>

							<p>
								Someone slapped him. Kip staggered. Rubbed his jaw.“Make the words, Kip,” Gavin said.So
								Kip told them everything. Liv stared woodenly at the floor when hetold of her leaving
								after he’d told her that he thought her father was dead.
							</p>

							<p>
								Commander Ironfist said, “General Danavis has been living in somebackwater village all
								this time?” He glanced at Liv. “Sorry, I knew we had aDanavis at the Chromeria, but I
								didn’t think you were related.” He clearedhis throat and shut up.“I wouldn’t be
								surprised if he did get away,” Gavin said. “The generalwas always a wily bastard, and I
								mean that in the best possible way.”
							</p>

							<p>
								Liv grinned, weakly and briefly. Kip told them the rest of it.After he finished, Gavin
								and Ironfist shared a look. “The Broken Eye?”
							</p>

							<p>
								Ironfist asked.
							</p>

							<p>
								Gavin shrugged. “Impossible to know. Of course, that’s the point.”“The what?” Kip
								asked.“My magisters told us that was a myth,” Liv protested. The Prism andthe commander
								of the Blackguard turned to look at her. She swallowed hardand stared at the floor.
							</p>

							<p>
								Ironfist said, “Your magisters are partly right. The Order of the Broken
							</p>

							<p>
								Eye is a reputed guild of assassins. They specialize in killing drafters.They’ve been
								rooted out and destroyed on at least three separate occasions,if not more. No satrap or
								satrapah enjoys losing drafters who’ve cost themso much before the end of their natural
								span. We believe that each time theorder has reformed, it’s been without any connection
								to any of the previousorders.”“To put it plainly,” Gavin said, “some thug rounds up a
								few more thugs,hoping to make a lot of money from backstabbing a few drafters, and
								theyname themselves the Order of the Broken Eye so they can demand heftypayments. It’s
								pure pretense.”“How do you know?” Kip asked.“Because if they were real, they’d be better
								at their job.”Kip scowled. His assassin had been pretty good.“It’s not to say they’re
								all equally incompetent, Kip,” Gavin said.“That’s the whole point. We shouldn’t even
								have brought it up. It doesn’tget us any closer to the real problem. Whether or not the
								order is real,someone sent an assassin to kill you. You haven’t been here long enough
								tomake any enemies, so it’s clearly an enemy of mine. There’s only one thingfor us to
								do.”
							</p>

							<p>
								Kip bit. “What?” He didn’t want to admit that he had already made anenemy. Surely that
								tester, Magister Galden, wouldn’t have sent an assassinafter him, would he?“We run
								away.” Gavin grinned, a reckless, boyish grin, eyes dancing.“What?!” Kip and Liv asked
								at the same time.“Meet me at the docks in an hour. Liv, that means you too. You’ll be
							</p>

							<p>
								Kip’s tutor. We’re going to Garriston.”“Garriston?” Liv asked.“Pack quick,” Gavin said.
								“You never know where the order is lurking.”
							</p>

							<p>
								He grinned again, teasing.“Oh, thanks,” Liv said.“Pack?” Kip asked as Gavin swept out of
								the room. “I don’t even ownanything!”
							</p>

								Chapter 54
							</p>

							<p>
								The prisoner studied the dead man. “I’m going to kill you,” he said quietly.“I don’t die
								easy,” the dead man said, his mouth twitching. He wasseated opposite Dazen, in his wall,
								knees folded, hands in his lap, his pose amockery of Dazen’s own. He glanced at the
								carefully woven rag in Dazen’slap. “Who would have thought?” the dead man mused. “Gavin
								Guile, sopatient, so quiet, so content doing women’s work.”
							</p>

							<p>
								Dazen studied his handiwork. Woven of his own hair as tight as he couldmanage with calm
								cool blue flowing through his body, he wasn’t even surehow long he’d spent on it. Weeks,
								maybe. It made almost a skullcap, asmall bowl. He studied the shiny interior. Finding,
								perhaps, a flaw, he tooka long but perfectly round fingernail and scraped it around his
								nose, overhis forehead in methodical strokes. Harvesting the accumulated skin and,more
								importantly, the precious oil with another fingernail, Dazen smearedthe oil carefully
								onto the flaw.
							</p>

							<p>
								He was only going to get one chance. After years and years, he wasn’tgoing to mess it
								up.
							</p>

							<p>
								With a steady hand and skin filled with blue, he gathered more oil andsmeared it on the
								wall directly over the dead man’s face.“This doesn’t change anything, Gavin,” the dead
								man said.“No, not yet,” he said.He stood and drafted a blade. He cut off a hank of his
								greasy hair. Hespat on it and scrubbed it against his dirty skin, getting it as foul as
								possible.“You don’t need to do this,” the dead man said. “It’s madness.”“It’s victory,”
								Dazen said. He drew the blue luxin blade smoothly acrosshis chest.“If you’re going to
								kill yourself, the wrist or the neck would workbetter,” the dead man said.
							</p>

							<p>
								Dazen ignored him. With dirty fingers, he pulled the cut open andtucked the putrid mass
								of hair and dirt under the flap of skin. Bloodcascaded down his chest, the red almost
								tempting him to try draftingdirectly, but it wasn’t enough, he knew that from
								experience. He put a handto his chest and pressed on the wound, holding it closed,
								slowing thebleeding.
							</p>

							<p>
								In a few sleeps, the cell would be cleansed with Dazen’s weekly bath.
							</p>

							<p>
								Soon thereafter, depending on how well he had planned and guessed, hewould either escape
								or be dead.
							</p>

							<p>
								As long as he held the blue, he found he didn’t care much one way orthe other.
							</p>

							<p>
								Chapter 55
							</p>

							<p>
								Liv cleared her throat awkwardly as she stuffed clothing into a bag. “I, um,came back
								here this morning to apologize,” she said.“Huh?” Kip said. The clothes in her hand were
								some lacyundergarments. Distracting.“You know, when you were busy trying to get
								killed.”“Oh, um, apology accepted?” Kip asked. What was she apologizing for?
							</p>

							<p>
								He shifted the weight on the pack that Commander Ironfist had given himbefore
								disappearing. Apparently it had taken Ironfist almost no time togather some spare
								clothing, a waterskin, tools, and even a short sword forKip. Kip still hadn’t figured
								out how to get the pack to sit comfortably onhis shoulders, though. He’d come to Liv’s
								room to help her pack, but shewasn’t making things any easier. He glanced at the short
								pants again.“They’re just underclothes, Kip.” Ack, caught!“They’re see-through,” Kip
								said. How could such a small bit of clothactually fit a person inside it?
							</p>

							<p>
								Liv looked down and colored a little, but played it off. She tossed theshort pants to
								Kip, who caught them instinctively, and instantly feltawkward. “Would you check if those
								are clean?” she asked.
							</p>

							<p>
								Kip’s eyebrows shot off his face and stuck somewhere three floors up.“I’m teasing. I
								just moved and they gave me all new clothes. Everythinghere is new.”“Except my
								gullibility, apparently,” Kip said. That was twice in as manydays she’d fooled him.
							</p>

							<p>
								She laughed. “You’re great, Kip. It’s like torturing the little brother Inever had.”
							</p>

							<p>
								Oh, the little brother comparison. Just what every man wants to hearfrom a beautiful
								woman. I’ve just been castrated. “So would I feel more orless awkward holding my
								sister’s underclothes?”
							</p>

							<p>
								Liv laughed again. “Would these be better or worse?” She held up someblack lace that
								looked like little more than two strings tied togetherartistically.
							</p>

							<p>
								Kip gaped.Then she held them up to her hips and cocked a saucy eyebrow at him.
							</p>

							<p>
								Kip coughed.“I think I need to sit down,” he said. She laughed like he hoped shewould,
								but he wasn’t completely kidding. He backed up toward a chair—and instantly bumped into
								someone.“Watch it,” Commander Ironfist said. “You don’t want to run intosomeone with
								that little sword sticking out.”
							</p>

							<p>
								Kip was too mortified for words. Little? Liv saw the look on his faceand burst out
								laughing so hard she fell on the bed. She laughed so hard shesnorted, a decidedly
								unladylike sound, and then that made her laugh harder.
							</p>

							<p>
								Turning around, Kip felt Ironfist’s firm hand guiding his pack awayfrom him so he didn’t
								stab him with the scabbarded short sword on top of it.
							</p>

							<p>
								Oh, that little sword. Relief flooded Kip, until he saw Ironfist glancedown at the sheer
								short pants in his hands.“You need me to find some in your size?” Ironfist asked
								drily.Liv snorted again, giggling so hard she was gasping for breath.“Aliviana,”
								Ironfist said. “You’re done packing? Because we’re leavingin five minutes.”
							</p>

							<p>
								Liv’s laughter stopped instantly. She popped off the bed and beganrummaging through her
								things at great speed. Ironfist let a small, satisfiedsmirk steal over his face briefly,
								then he dropped another pack next to Kip’sand walked out. Before Kip could ask him about
								it, Ironfist said, “Move it,boy genius. If you haven’t figured out the straps on your
								pack before I getback…”
							</p>

							<p>
								He didn’t complete the threat. He didn’t need to.Soon they were striding onto the docks
								together. Despite his threats,
							</p>

							<p>
								Ironfist had helped them with some settling of the packs. Mostly, that meantmoving
								things from Liv’s pack to Kip’s. When Kip asked the silent question—why are you making
								me carry her stuff?—Ironfist had said, “It’s morecomplicated to be a girl. You got a
								problem?” Kip shook his head quickly.
							</p>

							<p>
								As they walked down the docks, past fishermen unloading catches,apprentices of various
								trades running back and forth, loiterers, merchantwomen arguing with captains about
								prices for goods or transit—basically,all the normal business of the day—many people
								stopped whatever theywere doing for a few moments. It wasn’t to watch Kip, of course. It
								was towatch Commander Ironfist. The man was big, and imposing, andhandsome, and he
								strode with a total self-awareness, but it wasn’t his sheerphysical presence that got
								him so much attention. He was, Kip realized,famous.
							</p>

							<p>
								As Kip turned to see the faces looking at Commander Ironfist, he couldsee Gavin walking
								onto the docks. And if for Commander Ironfist, businessslowed, for the Prism, it stopped
								entirely. Gavin walked through smilingand nodding to people automatically, but they
								treated him like he wasnearly a god. No one tried to touch Gavin himself, but not a few
								brushed hiscloak as it floated past.
							</p>

							<p>
								What am I doing with these people?A week ago, Kip had been cleaning puke off his
								mother’s face and hairwhile she lay passed out from another binge. In their hovel. With
								a dirtfloor. No one in their backwater town had paid him the least mind. Theaddict’s
								boy, that’s all he was. Maybe the fat boy. I don’t belong here.
							</p>

							<p>
								I’ve never belonged anywhere. Mother told me I ruined her life, andnow I’m ruining
								Gavin’s.
							</p>

							<p>
								Kip couldn’t help but think of his mother’s last words, and the promisehe made as she
								was dying. He’d sworn to avenge her, and he’d hardly doneanything to keep that oath.
							</p>

							<p>
								They said Orholam himself watched over oaths. Kip hadn’t learnedanything, and now they
								were going back.“Hey,” Liv said, “why so glum?” She laid a hand on his arm, whichtingled
								from the contact. They’d stopped at an empty place on the dock,down a ramp low to the
								water, and Commander Ironfist was drafting a luxinplatform onto the water, the first
								building block of a scull.“I, uh, I don’t know. Thinking about Tyrea makes me think
								about—”
							</p>

							<p>
								And from somewhere that Kip didn’t even know he had, tears tried to comeup at the
								thought of his mother, dying. He pushed them away, diverted themto someone more worth
								mourning. “You know, I hope your father’s well,Liv. He was… he was always good to me.”
								He was the only one.
							</p>

							<p>
								Yet even with Master Danavis, there had been a wall, a point past whichhe wouldn’t let
								Kip in. Was it just because of his own history that he had tokeep secret? Or was there
								something deeper, something wrong with Kip?“Kip,” Liv said. “It’s going to work out.”He
								looked over at her and couldn’t help but smile. Orholam had nevermade a more beautiful
								woman. Liv could shame the sunset with herradiance. He fell into her dimples, hopeless.
								He looked away.
							</p>

							<p>
								Little brother, he sneered at himself. Fun to joke around with, but not aman. The
								despair threatened to choke him completely.“Thanks,” he managed to push past the lump in
								his throat. “Can I have asnack?” he asked Ironfist.“Yes, of course,” the big man
								said.“Great!”“When we get back.”“Hey!”“Now shut it, the Lord Prism is here.”All eyes
								still on him, Gavin stopped in front of Commander Ironfist. Helooked at Ironfist’s pack.
								Neither said anything for a long time.“You can’t come, I’m not taking a bodyguard,”
								Gavin said finally.“I’m not coming with you,” Ironfist said.“Then get off my scull.”“I’m
								coming with Kip. He’s a member of the Prism’s family, and he’sentitled to
								protection.”“You’re the commander of the Blackguard, you can’t possibly—”“I can do what
								I deem appropriate to discharge the duties of the
							</p>

							<p>
								Blackguard. None may interfere with that. None.”“You are a wily bastard, aren’t you?”
								Gavin said.“It’s why I’m still here,” Ironfist said. “And quite possibly why you
								are,too.”
							</p>

							<p>
								Gavin grunted. “You win, but let me remind you of your oaths.”Ironfist looked
								offended.“You’ll understand soon,” Gavin said. “Everyone, load up.”With a quick,
								practiced hand, Gavin drafted a set of the special oars heused to propel the scull, but
								he clearly left room for Ironfist to draft hisown, which he did, albeit much more
								slowly. Meanwhile, Gavin drafted abench for Kip and Liv to sit on, and straps to hold
								all the bags in the boat.
							</p>

							<p>
								Ironfist wrinkled his nose at that, as if wondering why the bags wouldneed to be
								strapped in, but he didn’t ask. In moments, they were off. Gavinmanned his oars, and
								Ironfist manned his, and they sped out into the bay.
							</p>

							<p>
								The scull began veering to port almost immediately. It was Gavin’s side.
							</p>

							<p>
								Kip realized Ironfist was rowing faster than Gavin, and the imbalance wasdriving them to
								port. Gavin looked over at Ironfist, who grinned back athim, continuing to sweep huge
								long strokes with his arms and legs. Gavinsped up. So did Ironfist. So did Gavin. Soon
								they were sculling across thewater at a nice pace.
							</p>

							<p>
								Liv looked over at Kip. “Can you believe this? I’ve never gone thisfast!”
							</p>

							<p>
								Kip laughed.“What?” she asked.“You’ll see.”The men settled into a rhythm. They were
								going fast, competing, butneither trying to bury the other. “When are we going to meet
								your ship?”Ironfist asked, raising his voice to be heard over the wind.“We’re going to
								cross the sea on this,” Gavin said.Ironfist laughed. “Right. You’ve got more endurance
								than I thought!”Kip grinned. The big Parian clearly didn’t believe Gavin, but waswilling
								to play along.
							</p>

							<p>
								After twenty minutes, they were out of sight of any other ships. Barelyslowing in his
								rowing, Gavin lifted one hand up and drafted one of the greattubes Kip had seen him use
								to propel the skimmer earlier. Ironfist looked atit quizzically.“This is what I meant
								about your oath,” Gavin said. “Secrecy.”“A tube attached to another tube. Your secret is
								safe with me, O Prism,”
							</p>

							<p>
								Ironfist said, grinning. “I hope it gets us out of this port turn, though.”
							</p>

							<p>
								Gavin dropped the tube into the water. The deck shuddered as the firstluxin ball hit the
								water streaming through the tube, then, as it quickly settledinto the whup-whup-whup
								that was familiar to Kip, the skimmer shotforward. The whole skimmer rose up, and
								Ironfist almost fell over as hisoars came free of the water.
							</p>

							<p>
								The skimmer sped up slowly and began to skip from one wave peak tothe next, then the
								skips got longer and longer, and soon the platformstopped hitting the waves at all.
								After a time, the astounded Ironfist joinedin and they skimmed even faster.
							</p>

							<p>
								The water was so clear, Kip could see the tube cutting through the wavesbelow them.
								Gavin had given each tube little wings. It was on those wingsthat the whole skimmer was
								flying above the surface. The wind wasincredible, but Kip could hear Ironfist whooping
								over it.
							</p>

							<p>
								Hours later, when the sun was halfway to the horizon, Gavin decided toswitch back to
								sculling before they came in sight of Garriston. As theskimmer settled back on the
								waves, Ironfist stepped away from his tube.
							</p>

							<p>
								His face was a writ of wonder, awe. He actually physically trembled.
							</p>

							<p>
								Then he swept into an elaborate bow before Gavin. “My Lord Prism,” hesaid, “you have
								made the world small.”
							</p>

							<p>
								Gavin bobbed his head, acknowledging the bow. “Small, maybe. Safe,no. Did you see a
								corvette over that way?”
							</p>

							<p>
								Ironfist shook his head. Their watercraft, no longer lifted up by theaction of the
								tubes, sat low in the water. But by the time Ironfist had draftednew oars, a corvette
								appeared, a league away, plowing right toward them.Ironfist cursed.
							</p>

							<p>
								Gavin grinned recklessly. “So Kip, Liv, you ever fought pirates?”
							</p>

							<p>
								Chapter 56“Surely you’re joking,” Ironfist said. “My Lord Prism,” he added belatedlyand
								not enthusiastically.“Let’s go hunting,” Gavin said.“My lord!” Ironfist said. “I can’t
								let you put yourself in that sort ofdanger. We can outrun these Ilytian scum. They’re
								not threatening ourmission or us.”“Do you know what this summer is, Commander?” Gavin
								asked.“I’m not sure what you’re asking.”“It’s time for the Ruthgari handover of
								Garriston,” Liv said as if thewords left a bad taste in her mouth.“Do you know why she
								sounded so happy about that?” Gavin asked
							</p>

							<p>
								Ironfist.“I’ve never served on this side of the Cerulean Sea,” Ironfist said.“I’m sure
								you know that each country that sided with me during the
							</p>

							<p>
								False Prism’s War has rotating stewardship of Garriston.”“Two years or something for
								each country, so no one gets long termdesigns on Tyrea. Can we have this conversation at
								a safer distance?” Heglanced at the pirates. They were making good progress in the
								afternoonwind.“That’s what it was supposed to do,” Gavin said. “Instead, eachgovernor
								has taken it as a personal chance to get rich. The Parians had thefirst rotation, and
								they stripped Garriston of everything that survived thefires. Every governor since then
								has followed their lead.”
							</p>

							<p>
								Liv spoke up. “During the first year, most governors try to keep the
							</p>

							<p>
								Umber River clear of bandits so the crops can get through. But most of thecrops come in
								too late on the second year. The governors don’t want to losemen killing bandits just to
								enrich the next governor from some othersatrapy, so they withdraw into Garriston. Only
								the most optimistic farmerseven bother planting on the second year anymore.”“While
								repeated sacking of Garriston and the surrounding country istragic, it doesn’t have much
								to do with these pirates,” Gavin said. “Thehandover happens after Midsummer’s, two weeks
								from now. The Ruthgarimerchants and craftsmen and wives and whores are busily loading
								theirships to take whatever plunder they’ve managed to steal this time home. Orjust
								whatever they brought with them. I suppose just because everygovernor so far has been
								corrupt doesn’t mean the smiths who shoe theirhorses are, too.”“This is fascinating,”
								Ironfist said, “but can’t some long guns shooteighteen or nineteen hundred paces?”“It’s
								farther away than that,” Gavin said. “Point is—”“Finally, thank Orholam,” Ironfist
								muttered.“Ahem. Point is, there’ll be an armada heading back to Ruthgar in twoweeks. The
								pirates descend like wolves, and they take any ships that getseparated from the main
								fleet.”“Serves them right,” Liv said.Gavin stared at her, and she scowled defiantly, but
								couldn’t handle theeye contact, so she scowled at the waves.“Some merchants try to beat
								the rush and get out before the rest of thefleet, hoping they’ll avoid the pirates.”“But
								here they are,” Liv said.“Exactly,” Gavin said. “And if there’s war this summer,
								especially—
							</p>

							<p>
								Orholam forbid—if we lose, there’ll be chaos. Dozens of ships, maybehundreds, all going
								their own direction, fleeing. A lot of the people in thoseships will be Tyrean,
								Aliviana.”
							</p>

							<p>
								She looked chastened.“Smoke,” Kip said.All conversation on the little scull stopped
								cold. Everyone turned tolook.“It would take an extremely skilled gunner to come within a
								hundredpaces of us at this distance,” Gavin said, but Kip noticed he didn’t take hiseyes
								off the corvette either.“Maybe it was an empty charge, just to let us know—”
							</p>

							<p>
								The water erupted twenty paces in front of the scull. The sound of theshot reached them
								only afterward.“That was quite a shot,” Gavin said. “The good news is that very
								fewcorvettes have more than one gun mounted on the front, so we should haveat least
								thirty seconds while they’re—”“Smoke!” Kip said.“I hate this part,” Gavin said. He and
								Ironfist scrambled onto their oarapparatus.
							</p>

							<p>
								This time, the splash was fifty paces in front of them.“Good to know the first one was
								lucky,” Liv said.“Unless the second was unlucky,” Kip said.Gavin looked at Ironfist, a
								momentary worry line pressed between hiseyes. “Let’s go.”“Right!”They began rowing and
								quickly picked up speed. “What can I do?” Kipasked. He hated feeling useless.“Think!”
								Gavin said.Think? Kip looked at Liv to see if she had any idea what Gavin meant.
							</p>

							<p>
								She shrugged.“Smoke!” she said.Excruciating seconds passed, then Kip heard an odd
								whistling hum. Thewater exploded fifty paces behind them.“Didn’t expect us to come
								straight at ’em!” Gavin shouted. “Next one’llbe closer!” He cackled.
							</p>

							<p>
								The man had gone quite mad.Smoke. This time, Kip counted. One. Two. Three. He strained
								his eyes.
							</p>

							<p>
								Surely he should be able to see something as big as a cannonball. Five. Si—Boom! The
								water exploded not fifteen paces to the left—port?—of thescull. Kip actually felt
								spray.“See?” Gavin said. “Talented gunner!”Mad. Totally mad. “It’s a six count between
								the smoke and the splash,”
							</p>

							<p>
								Kip announced.“Good!” Gavin shouted. “Ironfist, hard starboard as soon as they—”“Smoke!”
								Liv said.The men cut hard to starboard and the next shot splashed harmlessly agood
								distance away, albeit probably perilously close to where they wouldhave been.
							</p>

							<p>
								Another shot, and they turned even more to starboard. Again, the shotwas at least thirty
								paces off target. Kip looked at the wind and the sails ofthe Ilytian ship. They were
								cutting at a hard angle, sails full, wind steady. Itlooked like a good platform to shoot
								from, but as for how Kip could usewhat he was seeing to help them survive, he had no
								idea. He just didn’tknow anything about sailing. They were getting closer, though. Now
								the lagbetween the smoke and the shot was less than five seconds.
							</p>

							<p>
								The scull cut back and forth, sometimes even stopping, and though
							</p>

							<p>
								Kip’s fear never really shrank, he saw that Gavin was right. Their scull wassimply too
								fast, too small, too maneuverable to get hit—unless the gunnermade both a skillful and
								lucky shot. And though as they got closer to theIlytian ship they had less time to move
								between the cannon being fired andthe shot landing, the gunners were also having to
								change their angle moreand more.
							</p>

							<p>
								There was a long pause between shots.“What’s going on?” Kip asked.“Maybe they’re tired
								of wasting powder?” Liv asked hopefully.Ten seconds later, they had their answer as twin
								columns of smokeerupted from the cannons.“Port!” Gavin shouted.He’d guessed right. Water
								erupted both where they would have been ifthey’d gone straight and where they would have
								been if they’d turned tostarboard. Though it was longer between volleys, now the pirates
								couldmake two guesses of where the scull was headed instead of one.“Clever bastard!”
								Gavin said. “Time to cheat! Kip, switch me.” Heclambered off the oars, and Kip jumped
								in.“Straight,” Gavin said. Blue flooded his skin and he drafted a propulsiontube into
								the water. As before, they leapt forward. Kip and Ironfist almostfell as Gavin cut their
								oars smooth. But if he hadn’t, Kip realized, they’dhave been ripped apart by the
								inexorable turning of the gears.
							</p>

							<p>
								Gavin’s teeth gritted under the strain of pushing the entire boat byhimself, muscles
								knotting, veins standing out on his neck, but after amoment as they gained speed and it
								became easier, he said, “Ironfist, putfire grenadoes in all the cannon holes and the
								sails. Liv, cut the rigging.Kip, you…” He paused like he couldn’t think of anything for
								Kip the Ineptto do. “You call out anything you think I don’t see. Take my pistols.”
								Gavinpulled his hand from one of the tubes and drafted a basin and filled it withred
								luxin in moments. Ironfist instantly began drafting blue projectiles andfilling them
								with the flammable goo.
							</p>

							<p>
								They traversed the last five hundred paces before the men scrambling ondeck could reload
								the front cannons. Only one man seemed unfazed by theirimpossible speed.“Musketeer!” Kip
								shouted. One of the gunners, whether or not it wastheir cannoneer with the preternatural
								aim Kip didn’t know, stood at thebow, calmly tamping powder down his musket with a
								ramrod. With smooth,fast motions, he drew a square of cloth, reached into another pocket
								for abullet, and then tamped those. He held a smoking slow match in his teeth.
							</p>

							<p>
								As they got closer, Kip saw that the gunner was Ilytian, with skin asblack as gunpowder,
								aboriginal features, a scattered dark beard, short loosetrousers cut off below the
								knees, and an incongruously fine royal bluejacket over his lean frame with no shirt. His
								wiry black hair was bound in athick ponytail. His knees were bent, compensating for the
								rolling motion ofthe deck as naturally as breathing. He fixed the burning fuse into
								place.“I said, musketeer!” Kip shouted. They cut the water right beside thecorvette as
								the cannon portholes opened and the ship turned hard away fromthem.
							</p>

							<p>
								Gavin just turned with the bigger vessel. No one was going to doanything. Kip cocked the
								hammers of Gavin’s dagger-pistols, trying not toskewer himself on the long blades.
							</p>

							<p>
								The musketeer pivoted smoothly, aiming at Gavin. Kip raised bothpistols.
							</p>

							<p>
								The musketeer shot first. His gun exploded in his hands, knocking himoff his feet. Kip
								pulled both triggers. The pistol in his right hand scraped theflint against the frizzen,
								but didn’t throw a spark. Nothing happened. Thepistol in his left hand roared. It kicked
								back at Kip with far more force thanhe’d expected.
							</p>

							<p>
								Kip spun, tripped, and slid toward the back of the skimmer, rolling,scrambling. He saw
								Liv flinging both of her hands forward, then turning,her pupils tiny pinpricks as she
								drafted superviolet. Then she dove for him.
							</p>

							<p>
								Tumbling facedown, Kip lost sight of Liv, the ship, the drafters, and thebattle. All he
								saw was the slick blue of the skimmer’s deck, sliding awaybelow him. His face slid over
								the edge. His forehead skipped off the waterblurring past them, making his whole head
								bounce up, just about tearing hishead off his neck. On the second bounce, he wasn’t so
								lucky. His nose wentunder, and positioned off the back of the skimmer as he was, his
								nostrilsacted as twin scoops, jetting water up into his sinuses at great speed.
							</p>

							<p>
								Liv must have grabbed him, because there was no third bounce, but Kipcould see nothing,
								think of nothing. He was coughing, retching, crying,blind, spitting up salt water.
							</p>

							<p>
								By the time he propped himself up, the Ilytian corvette was two hundredpaces behind
								them. Its sails sagged, cut and burning. Smoke billowed out ofall the cannon portholes
								on the starboard side, and fire was visible on thedecks. And the whole ship was sitting
								low in the water. Men were leapingoff the decks on every side.
							</p>

							<p>
								Commander Ironfist, who’d barely said two words the entire time, said,“Men jumping off
								that fast means the fire must be headed for the—” Themiddle of the corvette exploded,
								sending wood and ropes and barrels andmen flying every direction. “—powder magazine,”
								Ironfist finished. “Sorrybastards.”“Men like those kill and rape and steal and enslave.
								They don’t deserveour pity,” Gavin said, slowing the skimmer. He was talking to Liv and
								Kip,who both sat almost equally wide-eyed. “But Ironfist’s right. It’s no easything to
								be the hand of justice.” He dropped the tube into the water. “We’llrow the rest of the
								way. By the by, nice shot, Kip.”“I hit him?”“Blew the captain right off his wheel.”“The
								wheel’s at the… uh, back, right?” The musketeer had been at thefront.“Stern?” Liv
								suggested.A dubious look. “You weren’t aiming at the captain, were you?”
								Gavinasked.“Aiming?” Kip asked, grinning.“Orholam have mercy, the nut doesn’t fall far
								from the tree,” Ironfistsaid. “However, luck is a—”“ ‘Luck’ is not dropping your
								father’s priceless, one-of-a-kind pistols inthe sea,” Gavin said.“I dropped your
								pistols?” Kip asked, heart dropping.“Whereas ‘slick’ is catching said pistols at the
								last moment,” Gavin said,producing the weapons from behind his back. He grinned.“Oh,
								thank Orholam,” Kip breathed.“You still almost lost my pistols,” Gavin said. “And for
								that, you get torow. Liv, you too.”“What?!”“You’re his tutor. He’s your responsibility.
								Everything he does wrong ison you.”“Oh, perfect,” she said.
							</p>

							<p>
								Chapter 57“It looks so… dirty,” Kip said. After seeing the wealth of Big Jasper and
								themagical edifices of the Chromeria, Garriston looked decidedlyunimpressive.“Dirt is
								the least of it,” Gavin said.Kip wasn’t sure what that meant, but he was sorry that he’d
								beenunconscious when he’d floated through the city the first time with Gavin. Ifhe had
								seen Garriston then, it would have doubtless been impressive. Itwould have been the
								largest gathering of humanity he’d seen in his life, atleast, if not the cleanest.
								Rekton’s alcaldesa would never have tolerated theheaps of trash Kip could see pushed
								into the alleys just off the docks, sittingright next to crates often holding food.
								Disgusting.
							</p>

							<p>
								The docks had perhaps forty ships, half-protected by a seawall withgreat gaps in it. Liv
								saw Kip looking at the holes, wondering if there wassome purpose for them. “The
								occupiers never really want to break theirbacks helping out us backward Tyreans,” she
								said. “The moorages oppositethe gaps in the seawall are given to locals. You should see
								the captainsscurry when a winter storm comes. The soldiers gather up in the towers
								andtake bets on whether individual ships will break up.”
							</p>

							<p>
								The scull, powered by Liv and a hard-breathing Kip, cruised pastgalleys, galleasses,
								corvettes, and fishing dories full of locals mending theirnets. The men and women
								stopped their work at the sight of a scull, muchless a scull with such an exotic crew.
								It warmed Kip just to see Tyrean facesagain. It made him feel at home. Only as they went
								past did he see thehostility on those faces.
							</p>

							<p>
								Ah, not much for foreign drafters. Guess that makes sense.“Where are we going?” Kip
								asked.Commander Ironfist pointed to the most magnificent, tallest building inthe city.
								From here, all Kip could see was the perfect egg-shaped tower witha spike pointing to
								heaven. A wide stripe around the widest part of thetower was inlaid with tiny round
								mirrors, none bigger than Kip’s thumb. Inthe afternoon sun, the tower seemed to be on
								fire. Above and below thatstripe of mirrors, similar stripes of other colors of glass
								were inlaid as well.“I sorta figured,” Kip said. “What I meant was, where should we
								dockthe scull?”“Right there,” Gavin said, pointing to a blank wall at the point nearest
								agate. It wasn’t a docking spot, and the level of the streets was a good fourpaces above
								the level of the water.
							</p>

							<p>
								Nonetheless, Kip and Liv steered—fairly expertly, Kip thought—towardthe wall. The
								scull’s nose dipped lower in the water as blue luxin bloomedon the front of the boat and
								snaked out. It solidified as soon as it touchedthe wall and became steps, locking the
								scull in place and giving them easyegress.“I’m still not used to this whole magic
								thing,” Kip said.“I’m thirty-eight years old,” Commander Ironfist said, “and I’m not
								usedto it. Just a little quicker to react. Grab your packs.”
							</p>

							<p>
								They did, and climbed the stairs to street level while locals looked atthem curiously.
								After they were all off, Gavin touched a corner of the stairs.All the luxin in the scull
								lost coherence and dissolved, falling into the wateras dust, grit, and goo depending on
								its color. The yellow even flashed alittle, much of its mass translated back into light,
								and the water popped up alittle, suddenly freed of the weight of the scull. Gavin, of
								course, paid it allno heed.
							</p>

							<p>
								This is normal for him. What kind of world have I stepped into? If
							</p>

							<p>
								Gavin were at dinner and misplaced his knife, he’d draft one rather than getup and look.
								If his cup were dirty, he’d draft a new one rather than clean theold. That gave Kip a
								thought.“Gavin—er, Lord Prism, why don’t drafters wear luxin?” Kip asked.Gavin grinned.
								“They do, sometimes. Obviously, yellow breastplatesand such are highly valued in battle,
								but I’m guessing you mean as clothes.”“You use magic for everything,” Kip said.“That’s
								me,” Gavin said. “A normal drafter isn’t going to shorten herlife just so she doesn’t
								have to dock her scull another fifty paces out. Well,some would, of course. The truth
								is, there was a fashion of wearing luxinclothing once, when I was a boy. With the
								application of enough will, evensome kinds of sealed luxin can become fairly flexible.
								Soon, there weredrafter-tailors who specialized in the clothing. But most people
								couldn’tafford them, and if you make your own, there are any number of mistakesyou can
								make. Some are fairly harmless, like making your pant legs toostiff. But if you made a
								mistake in the drafting, your shirt might dissolveinto dust in the middle of a day.
								Or”—Gavin cleared his throat—“certainmischievous boys might learn how to unseal the
								luxin that the tailor-draftershad woven. These boys might have caused some chaos at a
								memorableparty, where the ladies who’d gone to the expense of even having
								luxinundergarments found themselves in particular distress.” His mouthtightened, hiding
								a grin at a memory. “Sadly, the fashion ended ratherabruptly after that.”“That was you?
								I heard about that party,” Liv said.“I’m sure whatever you heard was much exaggerated,”
								Gavin said.“No,” Ironfist said. “It wasn’t.”Gavin shrugged. “I was a bad child.
								Fortunately, I’ve come a long waysince then. Now I’m a bad man.” He smiled, but it
								didn’t touch his eyes.“Here we go,” he said as three Ruthgari men approached.
							</p>

							<p>
								The three all wore what looked to Kip like wool sheets with a hole cutfor the head,
								carefully folded so there were pleats at their wide leather belts.The garment—a
								tunic?—then fell to the men’s knees. Though their legswere bare, the wool seemed
								entirely inappropriate for Tyrea’s climate, andall three were sweating freely. All wore
								leather sandals, though the guards’laced up into shin armor. The guards each carried a
								pilum, and a gladius anda crude pistol at their belts. The man in the lead, apparently
								in charge, hadhis tunic embroidered at the hem and on each breast. He carried a scroll,
								alarge bag slung over one shoulder, and a heavy purse at his belt. He wore apair of
								clear spectacles low on his nose.
							</p>

							<p>
								Clear spectacles? What kind of drafter would want clear spectacles?But as the men came
								close, Kip realized the man wasn’t a drafter at all.
							</p>

							<p>
								His eyes were clear brown. The men were also all pale, a common Ruthgaritrait, Kip
								guessed. With their skin barely bronzed, they weren’t pale orfreckled like Blood
								Foresters, but they still seemed pretty ghostly. Theirhair was a normal dark hue from
								brown to black, but straight, and fine.They walked with either authority or hauteur. Kip
								glanced at Liv. She wasdefinitely taking their attitude as the latter. She practically
								sneered at them.Kip thought she might spit at their feet.“I am the assistant
								portmaster,” the man said. “Where’s your vessel? Thetax is levied according to size and
								term of stay.”“I’m afraid the size of our vessel is negligible at the moment,”
								Gavinsaid.“I’ll be the judge of that, thank you. Where’d you dock?”“Right about there,”
								Gavin said, pointing.The assistant portmaster looked, then glanced up and down the
								wall,squinting. There were no ships within fifty paces. He folded his arms, hisjaw
								setting as if Gavin were making fun of him. “The tax isn’t heavy, but letme assure you,
								the penalty for attempting to evade taxation is.”
							</p>

							<p>
								One of the guards tapped the assistant portmaster’s shoulder, but theman ignored him.“As
								it should be,” Gavin said, still polite. He handed over a letter.The man held the letter
								low, so he was looking through his spectacles,like he was going to draft the letters
								right into words. “Oh,” he said quietly.“Oh, oh!”
							</p>

							<p>
								The man’s head snapped up, and he peered at Gavin’s eyes through hisspectacles. “Oh! My
								Lord Prism! A thousand pardons! Please, my lord, letus accompany you to the fortress. It
								would be a great honor to us.”
							</p>

							<p>
								Gavin inclined his head.“I sort of thought you’d pick them all up with magic and shake
								them orsomething,” Kip said, once they all fell in behind the guards and theassistant
								portmaster.“There’s a time to toss idiots around,” Gavin said. “But this man’s justdoing
								his job.” They walked into the shadow of the fortress, whose northernwall nearly
								overhung the harbor. Both of them looked up. There werearchers walking along the top of
								the wall, looking down at them. “Besides,”Gavin said, “you start throwing luxin around,
								you never know who’s goingto answer with gunfire.”
							</p>

							<p>
								The assistant talked to the men guarding the gate. Lots of furtive glancesat Gavin
								followed. Kip was busy looking at the fortress. The gate, and theentire fortress, was
								carved travertine. Mellow green, incised with acrosshatched pattern to make the stone
								look woven rather than carved.There were a number of murder holes cut in the gate. As
								the soldiersopened the gate, Kip saw that it led to a short killing ground,
								entirelyenclosed, with murder holes everywhere, then another gate. The guards atthe
								second gate, which was open, carried muskets with almost bell-shapedmuzzles. These guns
								were also shorter than the muskets the guards at theChromeria carried.
							</p>

							<p>
								Kip was next to Ironfist now, so he asked, “Why are their muskets
								soshort?”“Blunderbusses,” Ironfist said. “Instead of a ball, they load them
								withcobblers’ nails or chain. At short range you can hit four or five men. Orblow a good
								hole in one. Good for rioters. A man cut in half isn’t any lessdead than one with a
								small hole in his heart, but he’s a much greaterdeterrent to everyone else in the
								crowd.”“Nice,” Kip said, swallowing.After a few more checkpoints, at which they accrued
								a few more seniorguards, they climbed several floors. When they were on the third floor,
								theypassed an open door to chambers overlooking the sea. Gavin stoppedabruptly. Their
								escorts didn’t notice immediately. Ignoring them, Gavinwalked into the room.
							</p>

							<p>
								Ironfist, Kip, and Liv followed him. The room was a suite of apartments,filled with
								paintings, pillows, screens with ornate paintings of hunts,fireplaces, several
								chandeliers, and great long-handled fans for room slavesto waft their masters.
								Everywhere Kip looked, things sparkled, shined, andgleamed.“This,” Gavin announced as
								his escorts hurried in, “will be sufficient…”“Yes, Lord Prism, of course, this is the
								guest of honor’s suite. We’ll get—”“For my servants,” Gavin finished. “Kip, Liv, I trust
								you can stay out oftrouble while I get our accommodations arranged?”“Yes, of course, my
								Lord Prism,” Liv said, a formality and maturity inher voice that Kip wasn’t familiar
								with.“Start Kip’s drafting lessons. I’ll check up on you after I’m finished witha few
								things.”“Of course,” Liv said, curtseying. Kip half-bowed, and instantly feltdeeply
								foolish. He didn’t know how to bow. No one bowed where he grewup.“Ironfist?” Gavin
								said.Ironfist raised an eyebrow—oh, now you want me to go with you?“Best chance you’ll
								have to see a pompous Ruthgari governor get kickedout of his rooms. More if you’re
								lucky. Might even be someone you know.”
							</p>

							<p>
								The corner of Ironfist’s mouth twitched. “It’s the simple pleasures thatmake life
								beautiful, isn’t it?”
							</p>

							<p>
								Chapter 58
							</p>

							<p>
								The door closed behind them, and abruptly Kip and Liv were alone, awayfrom the important
								people and the matters of state. Children once more.
							</p>

							<p>
								Liv looked at Kip for a long time.“What?” Kip asked.“Sometimes it’s really strange to me
								that you are who you are. A weekago I would have blushed just at seeing Commander
								Ironfist. Now I’msitting in the finest rooms in the Travertine Palace—and they’re
								mine?”“I’ve given up trying to understand it all,” Kip said. “I think if I stop andthink
								too much—” I’ll become a blubbering baby. “Things will just fallapart.”
							</p>

							<p>
								In a moment, Liv’s face changed. Her eyes softened, compassion etchedon every feature.
								“You were there. In the village. When it happened.”“At Green Bridge with Isa and Sanson.
								And Ram, of course.” He stillwanted to sneer at the very thought of Ram, but that seemed
								cruel and smallnow. “Ram and Isa were killed. Sanson and I got away. But eventually
								theykilled him too.” Kip’s voice was wooden and distant even in his own ears.He couldn’t
								even look at Liv. If he saw her compassion, he’d break. Healready looked weak and
								foolish and young and fat in her eyes, a boy to bepitied. He didn’t need to make it
								worse by crying. “My mother made it outbut her skull was smashed. I was with her when
								she…”“Oh, Kip, I’m so sorry.”He pushed that down, pushed it aside. “Anyway, I really do
								hope yourfather got out. He was always good to me. In fact, if he hadn’t made meleave
								when he did, I’d be dead.”
							</p>

							<p>
								Liv said nothing for a time. Kip couldn’t decide if it was an awkwardsilence or not.
								“Kip,” she said finally, “I’ve been trying to work up thenerve to… Things can be really
								complicated now. With who your father is,and the way things are at the Chromeria…
								Sometimes things don’t really gothe way we want, and we—”“Am I supposed to have some
								idea what you’re talking about?” Kipasked. “ ’Cause…”
							</p>

							<p>
								She opened her mouth and looked at him again. Then he saw the gatescome down. “I’m just
								really glad you made it out, Kip.”“Thanks,” he said. Thanks for not trusting me enough
								to say whateveryou just wanted to say. “Should we get started?”
							</p>

							<p>
								She smiled wanly, like she wanted to say more but didn’t know how.“Sure. Come out to the
								balcony.”
							</p>

							<p>
								They walked out onto the balcony, which hung literally over the sea.
							</p>

							<p>
								From above, they could hear the muffled voices of men speaking on top ofthe Travertine
								Palace. Kip stood looking out at the sea, trying to put himselfin a frame of mind to
								concentrate, and said, “What do I do?”“To draft you need four things,” Liv said. “Skill,
								Will—”“Source, and Still,” Kip said. “Er, sorry, I have picked up a thing ortwo.”“Right.
								So there’s basically modifications and nuances to each of the bigfour, but that’s where
								it all starts. Let’s start with source.”
							</p>

							<p>
								Kip thought that he’d picked up a lot of what she was going to say, butone doesn’t
								interrupt a beautiful girl unless one is going to be funny. Livrummaged through her pack
								and pulled out a rolled-up green cloth and thena white one.“We’ll hold off on the color
								theory as much as we can,” she said. “Weknow you’ve drafted green. So your source can
								either be somethingreflecting green light in the world or you can take something that
								has greenas a component color and look at it through a lens.”“Huh?” Kip said. So much
								for this all being a repeat. “What do youmean reflecting green? You mean something
								green?”“Something you’ll learn the further you go in the Chromeria is that
								yourexperience of a thing and the nature of the thing itself are often
								differentthings.”“Sounds… uh, metaphysical,” Kip said. Hadn’t Gavin said somethinglike
								that?“Some take it that way, too, but I’m speaking strictly physically. Look atthis.”
								Liv pulled out another cloth. It was a red spectrum, but instead offlowing smoothly from
								the deepest to the lightest red, there were parts thattook steps back. “When you look at
								this, Kip, you can tell that it’s off. Itgenerally goes right, but there are subcolors
								out of sequence. Most mencan’t see that. They think it’s right. They can differentiate
								these fourspectral blocks here, but not these blocks inside. It doesn’t matter how
								hardthey try, or how long they study it. Their experience of it is less nuancedthan
								yours or mine. Now, quite honestly, we don’t know if what you and Isee is the totality
								of what is actually there, or if some people from beyondthe Great Desert might think
								we’re as blind as we think the men are whocan’t tell this from this.”“That’s weird.”“I
								know. In class, the magisters usually have every boy come to the frontand attempt the
								test, just because so many of the girls who can see thedifferences can’t believe that
								everyone else can’t see them too. It’s prettyhumiliating. Actually, I think it’s worse
								for the girls who can’t see it either.The boys aren’t expected to pass. The girls who
								can’t see it feel awful.” Sheshook herself. “Tangent. The point to remember, even if you
								don’t believe itnow, is that color doesn’t inhere in a thing. Things reflect or absorb
								colorsfrom light. You think this cloth is green. It’s not. Really it’s a cloth
								thatabsorbs all colors except green.”“This is us saving color theory for later?” Kip
								asked lightly.She paused, then she saw he was teasing and she smiled. “No you don’t,
							</p>

							<p>
								I’m not going to get drawn into more tangents. The point is, light isprimary. This
								cloth, in a dark room, is worthless to you. Obviously, you cantake the religious
								significances pretty deep, but you and I are only going totalk about the physical, not
								the metaphysical. You can draft green light.There are only a couple of ways for you to
								do that. The best is to have greenthings around you. Especially if you have lots of
								them. Especially if youhave lots of different hues and tones available.”“So, like a
								forest.”“Exactly. That’s why before the Unification, the green goddess Atiratwas
								worshipped in Ruthgar and the Blood Forest more than anywhere else.Green drafters
								flocked to the forests and the Verdant Plains because theywere more powerful there than
								anywhere else. In turn, those lands weredominated by the green virtues and the green
								vices, either simply becauseof the sheer amount of green being drafted there or because
								Atirat was real.Take your pick.”“That I don’t understand.”“We’ll worry about all that
								later. The second-best way to draft is to havespectacles. Like these.” She reached into
								her pack and pulled out a littlecotton pouch. Loosening the drawstring, she withdrew a
								pair of greenspectacles.“You don’t draft green,” Kip said.“No, I don’t,” Liv said,
								smiling.“They’re for me?” Kip asked. Tingles shot down his spine.Liv smiled broadly.
								“Usually there’s a little ceremony, but it amounts toa congratulations.”
							</p>

							<p>
								Kip took the spectacles gingerly. They had perfectly round lenses set ina thin iron
								frame. He put them on his face. Liv stepped close and measuredwhere the arms of the
								spectacles passed over his ears. Kip could smell her.Somehow, after a full day skimming
								across the entire sea and fightingpirates and then baking in the sun, she smelled
								wonderful. Of course, Kiphadn’t been this close to a woman very often—except his mother,
								usuallycovered with sweat or vomit on the nights he was unlucky and had to carryher
								home. Isa had smelled good too, but different than Liv.
							</p>

							<p>
								Isa had barely crossed Kip’s mind in the last days. He’d thought abouther, but there was
								something hollow there. He’d let himself daydream aboutkissing Isa someday, but maybe
								that had been more because she was therethan that she was perfect for him. Or because
								she was there and Liv wasn’t,and Kip needed something to distract him from thinking
								about Liv.
							</p>

							<p>
								And now here she was. She’d measured both sides, and she took hisspectacles off and was
								carefully bending the arms to fit behind his ears.“Hmm,” she said. “Your right ear’s
								higher than the left.”“My ears are lopsided?” Kip said. As if I didn’t have enough to be
								self-conscious about.“Don’t worry, mine are too! Really, most people’s are off a little
								bit.”
							</p>

							<p>
								She paused. “Just not quite so much.” She shook her head in disbelief.“I’ve got freakish
								ears?”Liv grinned wickedly. “Gotcha.”“Orholam’s ba—Ahem, beard.” Kip scowled. Every
								time. Every stinkin’time.
							</p>

							<p>
								She smiled, self-satisfied, and gave the nose pieces a final bend, thenpropped the
								spectacles on his face. “There. You might have to play withthem to make them more
								comfortable, but they aren’t really meant to be onyour face all day long anyway.”
							</p>

							<p>
								He looked around, and was not terribly surprised to see that mosteverything had a
								greenish tinge through the green glass.“What you’re seeing is white light from the sun
								reflected off of surfaces,then filtered through your lenses. So if you’re surrounded by
								white marblewalls or something, you’ll be able to draft almost as much as if you were
								ina forest. The lenses aren’t as good as drafting from natural greens, but it’sbetter
								than nothing. You can’t just look at anything, though. Look around.You see how some
								things really look green, and others don’t? Like if youlook at this cloth, what color
								does it appear to be?” She drew another clothout of her bag.“Uh, red.” Kip thought he
								could hear Gavin’s voice from the floor abovethem, getting louder, angry.“It is
								red.”Refocusing his attention on Liv, Kip looked over his glasses, and thoughthe cloth’s
								tone was changed a little, it was indeed red. “So how does thatwork?” he asked.“The
								spectacles will only help if there are surfaces that are reflectinggreen to you. White
								surfaces work best because white is all the colorstogether. Much less good, but
								sometimes possible, will be drafting throughyour lenses when looking at yellow or blue
								surfaces, since green is asecondary color.”“Lost me there.”“So now you want the color
								theory?” She grinned, joking. “For yourpurposes, if you need to draft, the spectacles
								will help most if you can findthings that are either white or light-colored. Ripe wheat
								would work, aspruce tree won’t,” Liv said.“I think I can remember that,” Kip said. The
								whole things-aren’t-the-color-they-are thing really didn’t make sense, but he suspected
								he couldwrestle with that later.“Good, so that covers source. For the time being.”You
								mean we still have to cover skill, will, and still?Liv said, “I don’t want to beat this
								to death, and I’m sorry you don’t getto have the ceremony, because maybe that helps this
								sink in. Thosespectacles are now your most important possession. Not only do
								mostdrafters have to save up for months or even a year to afford one pair ofspectacles,
								but everyone then immediately saves for a spare pair. If you getrich, or if the Prism
								orders it, I suppose, you can have a custom pair madeby the lens grinders. They can give
								you a darker or lighter green or adjustthe frame for fit or looks. But without your
								spectacles, you’re close topowerless. I know you’ve been with the Prism, but he’s the
								exception. Hedoesn’t need spectacles. His eyes don’t halo. He can use as much magic ashe
								wants. The rules don’t apply to him. Even the rules for Prisms don’tseem to apply to
								him. Can you imagine anyone else coming in here, alone,and simply taking over? From the
								Ruthgari? And the funny thing is, they’regoing to take it. They won’t like it, but
								they’ll—”
							</p>

							<p>
								A man’s voice from the roof interrupted her. “I don’t give a good god’sdamn what your
								paper says, there’s no way you’re—” The man cut off witha yelp.
							</p>

							<p>
								Kip looked up just as a man plunged past their balcony. He landed farbelow with a huge
								splash in the bay, and Kip saw him struggle to thesurface, spluttering, his rich clothes
								billowing in the water. He startedcrying for help.“This is outrage—!” someone started to
								shout, then Kip saw anotherman plunge past the balcony. He splashed in the bay, almost
								on top of thegovernor.
							</p>

							<p>
								There was a gigantic burst of light. “So help me, the next one of youisn’t going to land
								in water,” Gavin said, his voice ringing.
							</p>

							<p>
								Kip expected to hear gunshots—surely the governor had guards—butthere was nothing. They
								took it.
							</p>

							<p>
								That’s my father. That’s my father?Gavin imposed his will, and the world took it.“So,”
								Kip said, feeling very much like the men floundering in the baybeneath him, barely able
								to swim and desperate to be pulled out. “So. Will.That’s next, right?”
							</p>

							<p>
								Chapter 59
							</p>

							<p>
								Corvan Danavis approached Garriston as the sun set. The outer walls ofGarriston, of
								course, had long ago been demolished. During the Prisms’War—Corvan never thought of it
								as the False Prism’s War—he had set mento working on rebuilding them, but there just
								hadn’t been time. The outerwalls had been built to shield a city of hundreds of
								thousands. At the timeof the war, there had been perhaps ninety thousand. There had been
								no wayto protect them all.
							</p>

							<p>
								The irrigation canals that could have been watering all the land betweenthe outer walls
								and the inner walls were broken, except for one or two. Butthe inner walls still stood,
								as did the Ladies.
							</p>

							<p>
								The Ladies, mostly now stripped of associations with the goddess Anat,guarded each gate.
								Each was an enormous white statue, incorporated intothe wall itself. Each had
								represented an aspect of Anat: the Guardian wasthe colossus standing astride the
								entrance to the bay; the Mother guardedthe south gate, heavily pregnant, defiant, dagger
								bared; the Hag guarded thewest gate, leaning heavily on a staff; the Lover lay across
								the river gate tothe east. For reasons Corvan had never understood, the Lover was
								depictedperhaps in her thirties while the Mother was depicted as very young,perhaps
								still in her teens. Each was carved of the most expensive, faintlytranslucent white
								marble, such as was only available in Paria—Orholamalone knew how they’d shipped so much
								this far. The statues, luckily, hadbeen coated in the finest sealed yellow luxin—all of
								one piece. Astoundingwork. The city had been invaded at least three times, and still the
								Ladieswere unmarked, even after the fiery devastation of the great conflagration.
							</p>

							<p>
								Anat, the Lady of the Desert, the Fiery Mistress, the sub-red, had beenthe goddess of
								all hot passions: wrath, protection, vengeance, possessivelove, and furious lovemaking.
								When Lucidonius had taken the city forOrholam and eliminated the cult, his followers had
								wanted to tear down thestatues, which, granted, would have taken some powerful
								drafters.Famously, Lucidonius had stopped them, saying, “Tear down only what isfalse.”
								Several times in the intervening centuries, zealous Prisms hadwanted to tear down the
								pagan relics anyway, but each time the city hadthreatened war. Until the Prisms’ War,
								Garriston had had enough militarypower that a threat of going to war with her was
								daunting.
							</p>

							<p>
								Corvan had never approached the Lover at sunset. As with the other
							</p>

							<p>
								Ladies, her body was incorporated into the gate. She lay on her back, backarched over
								the river, feet planted, her knees forming a tower on one bank,hands entwined in her
								hair, elbows rising to form the tower on the otherbank. She was clad only in veils, and
								before the war a portcullis could belowered from her arched body into the river, its
								iron and steel hammeredinto shape so that they looked like a continuation of her veils.
								But in thewar the portcullis had been broken and never replaced.
							</p>

							<p>
								The sight of her still took Corvan’s breath. With the sun setting, the thinyellow luxin
								sealing the statue, usually nearly invisible, was set alight. Theyellow was like golden
								bronze skin, fading slowly as Corvan walked andthe sun sank, finally leaving only a
								welcoming silhouette—a wife waitingabed for her long-absent husband.
							</p>

							<p>
								It sent a pang through him. He could never come here without thinkingof Qora, his first
								wife. Liv’s mother. Qora had greeted him like that once,lying abed, clad only in veils,
								deliberately mimicking the Lover whenCorvan had returned to her. Even now, eighteen
								years later, grief andremembered desire and joy and love twined in his breast. Corvan
								hadremarried in Rekton, two years after Qora’s death, but marrying Ell hadbeen more to
								give Liv a mother than for love. Three years later, Ell hadbeen murdered by an assassin
								who’d finally tracked Corvan down. Corvanhad considered moving, but the alcaldesa begged
								him to stay, and Kip wasthere, so he’d stayed. But he’d not remarried again, not even
								with theoverwhelming number of women for every man in Rekton and the constantcarping of
								the would-be matchmakers. He couldn’t love as he had lovedbefore. Losing another woman
								he loved as much as he’d loved Qora wouldkill him, and it wasn’t fair to ask another
								woman to act as mother to hisdaughter if he wasn’t willing to love her with his whole
								heart. Corvan nolonger had a whole heart to give.
							</p>

							<p>
								He trudged on, past farms with their thin but ripening crops of spelt andbarley, trying
								not to look at the Lover stretched luxuriously before him.Reaching the gate, which
								opened through the spilling tresses of her hair, hejoined the line of men and women
								heading back into the city, brushing pastthose heading back out for the night. He kept
								his eyes down as he passedbetween two Ruthgari guards who had still been on their
								mothers’ kneesduring the war. They were barely paying any attention to the stream
								ofpeople passing by them, however. One was leaning against the Lover’scascading hair,
								his foot propped against the rippling stone, his strawpetasos, the characteristic
								Ruthgari broad-brimmed hat, thrown back tohang from his neck now that the sun wasn’t
								beating down on them. “…think he’s here for?” he was asking.“Scorch me if I know, but
								they say he threw Governor Crassos into thebay. I suppose we’ll…”
							</p>

							<p>
								Corvan couldn’t hear any more without pausing, and pausing meantinviting attention.
								Inviting attention might mean making eye contact, andwith Corvan’s red-haloed eyes, that
								wasn’t a good idea.
							</p>

							<p>
								So someone powerful has come to Garriston, but who was powerfulenough to throw a
								governor in the bay? Corvan didn’t know anything aboutthis Governor Crassos, but the
								Ruthgari royal family had half a dozenyoung princes. Most likely one of them had been
								sent to help oversee thewithdrawal from Garriston. No one else would dare throw a
								Ruthgarigovernor into the sea.
							</p>

							<p>
								An impulsive prince actually might be better for Corvan’s purposes thana comfortable
								governor. Harder to deal with at first, but more likely toprepare for war, and war was
								what Corvan was bringing, like it or not.
							</p>

							<p>
								As he passed through the city, he found himself analyzing it like thegeneral he used to
								be. King Garadul might be a monster, but the Ruthgariwere the occupiers. Who would the
								people of Garriston join, and wouldthey join enthusiastically or not? As Corvan walked,
								he paid particularattention to the Ruthgari soldiers. At times, the men walked singly,
								runningerrands for their commanders or simply heading back to barracks or out totaverns.
								He saw a soldier get jostled on accident by a vendor closing hiscarpet stall who backed
								up too quickly. The soldier pushed past like it wasan annoyance, but never checked his
								back. The vendor, a native Tyrean,apologized respectfully, but without fear.
							</p>

							<p>
								This wasn’t a city on the verge of revolt. The Tyreans had grownaccustomed to being
								occupied. The Ruthgari were the fourth satrapy to doso, and this was their second time
								around. Not every nation got a turn in theoccupation and spoils. Paria had had the first
								two years, and if they’d hadthe richest spoils to steal, they’d also had the task of
								putting down the mostrebels. The Ilytians had ostensibly fought on Dazen’s side, and had
								nocentral government anyway, so they didn’t get a turn. The Aborneans hadpreferred to
								trade with both sides, and had entered the fight only after theBattle of Sundered Rock.
								They didn’t get a turn either. That left the Parians,the Atashians, the Blood Foresters,
								and the Ruthgari. In that order, ifCorvan remembered correctly. It made sense that the
								people of Garristonwould have their favorites, or at least those less hated, among
								theiroccupiers.
							</p>

							<p>
								It took Corvan only a bit of mental shuttling to figure that with the
							</p>

							<p>
								Parians replacing the Ruthgari, this would be the third time Garriston hadendured the
								Parians. The most easily tolerated occupiers were about to bereplaced by the most hated
								ones.
							</p>

							<p>
								But the question his observations didn’t answer was just how much fearwas mixed with the
								hatred of the Parians. The Parians had put down rebelsboth times they’d ruled. Maybe
								their cruelty meant the Tyreans would thinktwice before taking up weapons. It might mean
								they would take them upmore quickly. Corvan didn’t know, couldn’t know without spending
								a lot oftime in the city. Time he didn’t have.
							</p>

							<p>
								The city was more cosmopolitan than it had been the last time he hadvisited, some ten
								years ago. Before the war, Garriston had been as populousand diverse as any rich port
								city in the world. After the war, everyone whocould leave had left, especially those who
								looked like they were fromelsewhere. Tensions had run high. During that time, the only
								people inGarriston were native Tyreans and their occupiers of the moment.Apparently,
								with each round of occupation, a few traders and soldiers hadstayed and intermarried
								with locals. Corvan saw two shopkeepers chattingas they swept out their open stalls with
								straw brooms. One woman had thetraditional Tyrean caramel skin and dark full brows and
								wavy hair, whilethe woman next to her had skin like honey, and ash blonde hair, rare
								evenfor the Ruthgari. They were dressed almost identically, bangles on theirwrists, long
								flax skirts, hair tied back with scarves.
							</p>

							<p>
								Corvan passed an alley where children played gada together, kickingand passing a ball of
								wrapped leather. There were more obviously Tyrean-blooded children than any other kind,
								but the teams were mixed. A fewmothers had gathered to watch, and they stood close to
								each otherregardless of what Corvan would have guessed were their origins, gossipingor
								shouting encouragement.
							</p>

							<p>
								Not a powder keg. That was good. A radical shift in power andlawlessness in a city where
								neighbor hated neighbor would have invitedwanton bloodshed. Garriston had seen enough of
								that.
							</p>

							<p>
								The water market, basically an outsized version of what Rekton had,was nearly empty
								except for a few food vendors offering quick meals topassing soldiers and those who had
								otherwise missed dinner. Corvan boughta few skewers of rabbit and fish marinated in a
								fiery Ilytian pepper sauceand kept walking.
							</p>

							<p>
								Before he headed to the Travertine Palace, Corvan walked to the Hag’s
							</p>

							<p>
								Gate. Here, like the Guardian’s Gate and the Lover’s Gate, the statue wasworked into the
								wall. But this time Corvan had no interest in the statue. Hehad come to watch the
								soldiers. The gates had closed for the night, though ithad doubtless been a long time
								since raiders had dared move against thecity itself. The soldiers who stood at the top
								of the wall were joking,laughing, talking loudly, even drinking when their superiors
								left. Corvanhad seen archers atop the Hag’s Crown and at the top of the Hag’s Staff—the
								two towers on either side of the gate—but after the two women settledin, quivers laid
								down, bows unstrung, they never made a circuit of theirrespective posts.
							</p>

							<p>
								So, soldiers with little discipline. Soldiers who had become city guards,through no
								fault of their own. In the first year of an occupation, the soldiersmight be sent
								against raiders and brigands or patrol the river’s length. Afterthat, they retreated to
								the city and became guards. The soldierly duties cameto seem extraneous, and discipline
								slipped. Sitting watch in towers wherethere was never anything to watch for soon became
								a post where soldiersgambled and drank.
							</p>

							<p>
								Corvan headed toward the Travertine Palace. Of course, there was noway they were going
								to let some peasant walk in off the street and meettheir prince, so when he got close to
								the front gate, he ducked into an alley.
							</p>

							<p>
								After Karris had been captured, Corvan had scouted King Garadul’s campenough to decide
								that any attempt at rescue would be suicide. Then, asthey’d rendezvoused with other
								generals, swelling the army—most likelywith forced levies—they’d turned south. Corvan
								had headed back to a caveoutside of Rekton.
							</p>

							<p>
								He was almost disappointed that thieves had never found his cache.
							</p>

							<p>
								When Rekton’s alcaldesa had told Corvan that he and his daughter couldstay, he’d hidden
								away everything that could connect him to the war, bothfor his new home’s sake and his
								own. He’d shaved off his distinctivebeaded mustache and traded rich clothes and weapons
								for flaxen pants anda dyer’s shop. What had seemed meager gold in his pockets then was
								now afortune in his eyes, but in the intervening years it had all been unspendable.No
								one in Rekton had gold coins, especially not stamped with a BloodForester satrap’s face.
							</p>

							<p>
								So now he pulled out the long folded samite tunic, swept off a portion ofthe ground with
								his hand and laid it on it. Next came a broad leather beltembossed with crocodiles with
								tiny ruby eyes in emerald-dotted swampswith diamond-eyed herons. Last, he drew out
								Harbinger, the sword that hadpassed to him only when the last of his elder brothers
								died. A young boy saton the curb opposite him, silently watching, quizzical. Corvan
								tried toignore him. He stripped off his long shirt and pulled out a mirror. Withmirror
								and a skin of water, he did his best to clean himself up. Then hedried himself with the
								dirty shirt and pulled on his rich clothes. There wasnothing to be done about his boots
								or pants, but the samite tunic and thestress was going to have him sweating enough as it
								was. After packing histhings and strapping Harbinger onto his belt and pushing his hair
								intosomething resembling order, he took a deep breath and rounded the corner,approaching
								the gate.“I need to see whoever’s in charge,” Corvan said to the guards, walkinglike a
								man with purpose.“Uh…” one of the guards said, looking confused and glancing at theother
								guard. Apparently they didn’t know if he meant the governor or theprince.“Whoever threw
								the governor in the bay,” Corvan said. “It’s anemergency.”
							</p>

							<p>
								The guards shared a look. “Got no reason not to waste his time,” oneguard said to the
								other. “He’s not exactly given us cause to screen hisvisitors carefully.”
							</p>

							<p>
								The other Ruthgari soldier grinned. “We’ll take you right to him, sir.”They didn’t even
								ask his name. Corvan followed them, astounded by hisgood fortune. Apparently the
								prince—presumably a younger prince or theRuthgari wouldn’t dare behave this way—hadn’t
								been endearing himself tothe common soldiers. Even more incredibly, the soldier marched
								himstraight to the counsel room. Corvan hadn’t been there in sixteen years. Theman
								rapped a quick code on the door, and the guards inside opened it. Hewhispered something
								about emergency, looks important, to the guard, andthen beat a hasty retreat.
							</p>

							<p>
								The counsel room guard, a tall, serious Ruthgari, ushered Corvan in.“Name?” he asked
								quietly.
							</p>

							<p>
								Corvan stepped inside. The Ruthgari prince was leaning over a table inthe counsel room,
								his back to Corvan. “Corvan Danavis,” Corvan saidquietly. There was a huge—both tall and
								thickly muscled—ebony guardstanding across from the prince, his eyes hard, studying
								Corvan, taking noteof the sword at his side. He wore all black. This prince had some
								nerve,pretending to have his own Blackguard. When the Chromeria found outabout that, it
								would not be pleased.“Corvan Danavis,” the guard announced loudly. “He says he has
								anemergency message, my Lord Prism.”
							</p>

							<p>
								It was like lightning hit all three men at once. The Blackguard—anactual, real
								Blackguard, for Orholam’s sake—had two pistols out and hisblue spectacles on half a
								breath after Corvan’s name was announced.
							</p>

							<p>
								The Prism—not a princeling, Gavin Guile himself—stood and turned.
							</p>

							<p>
								His lip curled. “General Danavis, it’s been too long.”
							</p>

							<p>
								Chapter 60
							</p>

							<p>
								Gavin kept his face carefully neutral. After sixteen years, Corvan Danavisstill looked
								fit, healthy, and sharp as ever. His skin was deeply tanned, nodoubt to try to cover the
								freckles and look as Tyrean as possible, and therewas no sign of his famous beaded
								mustache. His blue eyes were only abouthalf-haloed with red, not much more than when
								Gavin had last seen him.The lines, both smile lines and deeper worry lines, were new,
								however. Hiseyes flicked to Ironfist, and then he looked dismayed.
							</p>

							<p>
								Consummate actor, Corvan Danavis.“Commander Ironfist, please relieve this man of his
								weapons, andreprimand the guards. Carefully, yes?” Ironfist would understand
								instantly.The Ruthgari guards couldn’t be too harshly treated or it might inspiregeneral
								fury at the new boss. But if Gavin let such lax—or possibly insolent—duty stand
								uncorrected, the Ruthgari soldiers wouldn’t respect him.Ironfist would put the fear of
								Orholam into the guards, without actuallymaking them hate Gavin.“You wish me to leave
								you with this traitor, Lord Prism?” Ironfist knewas well as Gavin did that the original
								guards who’d allowed Corvan into thepalace would have beaten a hasty retreat, which
								meant he’d have to go afterthem and wouldn’t be close if things got out of hand.
							</p>

							<p>
								Gavin nodded curtly.Ironfist lowered the hammer of one pistol and tucked it into his
								beltwithout taking his eyes or the other pistol off Corvan. He walked forwardand took
								Corvan’s sword, eyes flicking only briefly to it in appreciation.After putting the sword
								and Corvan’s bag in a small closet off the mainroom, he put away his other pistol and
								frisked Corvan briskly.
							</p>

							<p>
								Before turning to go, Ironfist looked one more time at Gavin. Are yousure? You know this
								is a bad idea, right?
							</p>

							<p>
								Gavin nodded fractionally. Go.The door closed behind Ironfist. Gavin looked around the
								room. Hehadn’t been here long enough to know if there were peepholes oreavesdropping
								tunnels behind the walls. Corvan stood, hands folded,waiting patiently. “Come out onto
								the balcony, General.”“Please, I’ve not been a general for many years,” Corvan said, but
								hefollowed Gavin out. Gavin closed the double doors behind them. Thebalcony was
								spacious, with a number of chairs and tables spread out so thegovernor and his visitors
								could enjoy the view over the bay. It made Gavinglad he’d flung the governor a long way.
								Dropping the man off the roofonto this wouldn’t have been quite as humorous—and he
								hadn’tremembered this balcony protruding quite so far. Lucky, Gavin.
							</p>

							<p>
								Funny that I always think of it as luck, rather than Providence.Corvan glanced over the
								edge. “Bay looks deep enough here,” he said,the corner of his mouth twisting wryly.
							</p>

							<p>
								Gavin leaned on the balcony’s railing. The sun was just touching thehorizon, setting the
								sea alight, pinks and oranges threaded through thinclouds. Suddenly, the lost years were
								rolling down his cheeks and he washolding the railing like a drunk, simply to be able to
								stand. “It cost toomuch, Corvan.”
							</p>

							<p>
								Corvan glanced around for spies, checking the docks, looking back intothe counsel room,
								up at the roof. He said, “It’s good to see you too. Nowquit that or you’re going to get
								me started.”
							</p>

							<p>
								Gavin glanced at him. Corvan wore his quirky grin, but his eyesbetrayed him. That grin
								was him trying to give his face something to do sothe depth of his emotion didn’t
								overwhelm him.
							</p>

							<p>
								Suddenly, appearances didn’t matter. Gavin embraced his old friend.“It’s good to see
								you… Dazen,” Corvan whispered. That broke open thefloodgates for both of them. They
								wept.
							</p>

							<p>
								The grand deception had been Corvan’s idea from the beginning, sixteenyears ago. It had
								been a throwaway idea when he’d proposed it. Neither hadreally believed Dazen could beat
								Gavin. One night, when they’d had a rarerespite from the battles and had been sharing
								one too many skins of wine,Corvan had said, “You could win and simply take Gavin’s
								place.”“That’s sort of the point of a Prisms’ War, isn’t it? Last man standing?”
							</p>

							<p>
								Dazen had said. “Last Prism shining?”
							</p>

							<p>
								Corvan ignored the joke. Dazen was a little further gone than he was.“No, I mean you
								could be Gavin. You two look almost the same. For years,every time the two of you played
								scrum, the only way anyone could tell youapart was Gavin’s prismatic eyes. You have
								those now.”“Gavin’s a peacock. And I’m taller.”“Clothes can be changed. And he wears
								lifts in his shoes to makehimself as tall as you are. Which would actually make things
								easier.”“He’s got that scar. Which you gave him, I might add,” Dazen had said.“I could
								give you one too. Nice symmetry to that, huh?”Now Dazen was taking it seriously. “I’ve
								gone a while without a haircut.
							</p>

							<p>
								The scar’s right along the hairline. I could hide the cut while it washealing.”“If I can
								remember which side I cut him on,” Corvan said. “Pass me thatskin, I’m getting parched.”
							</p>

							<p>
								A few days had passed, and Dazen had asked Corvan to stay afteranother council of war.
								After dismissing everyone from the tent, he’dhanded Corvan a piece of paper. On it was
								written a precise description ofGavin’s scar.“I was joking,” Corvan said, looking into
								Dazen’s serious eyes.“I’m not. I’ve got a chirurgeon waiting outside the tent to stitch
								me up.
							</p>

							<p>
								If anyone notices, we were sparring and had an accident. I’m embarrassedabout my
								clumsiness, so I asked you not to say anything about it.”
							</p>

							<p>
								Corvan had said nothing for a long time. “Dazen. Have you thoughtabout what this would
								mean? You’d have to maintain a charade for years,maybe the rest of your life. Everyone
								who loves you now would think youdead. Karris—”“I lost Karris when I killed her
								backstabbing brothers.”“Are you prepared to be Gavin in her eyes?” Corvan had
								asked.“Corvan, look at our allies,” Dazen had said, tense, lowering his voice.“I’ve
								practically sworn a port in every satrapy to the Ilytians. I’ve promisedthe Atashian
								throne to Farid Farjad. The cultists joined us in hopes that theirstrength would help us
								shatter the Chromeria. Once we win, they’ll turn onus. And the Blue-Eyed Demons have
								been too valuable to us to be contentwith mercenaries’ wages. I expect Horas Farseer to
								come to me on the eveof the battle with some outrageous demand: lands, titles, permanent
								bases.
							</p>

							<p>
								I’ll have to agree. After we win, I might renege with one group, but notwith all of
								them. I don’t know how it got to this, but however things started,we’re the bad guys
								now.”“We’re the bad guys. After what they did to Garriston,” Corvan saidbitterly.“In
								terms of what will happen to the Seven Satrapies if we win? Yes.”A long silence. “You’ll
								be discovered eventually,” Corvan said. “Youmust know that. It can’t last forever.”“I
								don’t need to fool them for long. A few months. Enough toconsolidate the victory. Even
								if the Spectrum found out, they wouldn’texpose me until our enemies are crushed. Some
								morning, I won’t rise frommy bed. I can accept that.”“We’re not without options,” Corvan
								said. “I mean, if we win. Theseproblems can be handled. We don’t know what will happen
								after we win. Ifwe can take Gavin’s army relatively intact and get the Chromeria
								tocapitulate quickly, we could counter—”“Do you see the White capitulating
								quickly?”Corvan opened his mouth. Closed it. “No.”“It’s not a good plan,” Dazen said. “I
								know that. But it may be the leastbad.”“We may still lose, I suppose,” Corvan said.“You
								always do look on the bright side,” Dazen had said.Now Corvan pushed Gavin back, wiping
								his own tears away with thebacks of his hands. “I’ve missed you, friend.”“And I you.
								Now, what the hell are you doing here?” Gavin asked.The joy at their reunion leached
								from Corvan’s face. “I came to warn thegovernor that King Garadul’s marching here. His
								army will arrive withinfive days, a week at most. And they captured Karris White Oak.”
							</p>

							<p>
								Gavin sucked in a breath. Karris captured?There was nothing to be done about it now,
								even if it did tear a hole inhis stomach and hollow him out. “I knew about King
								Garadul,” he said.“Not… the other.”“I figured. Why else would you be here?” Corvan
								said.“You think he’ll attack just after Midsummer’s?” Gavin asked.“The day after,”
								Corvan said. “Ruthgari will have withdrawn, but the
							</p>

							<p>
								Parian regiments won’t have landed.”
							</p>

							<p>
								It was what Gavin had guessed. It gave him almost no time. “I can’tbelieve that Governor
								Crassos never got word of Garadul’s army.”“Don’t believe it. He did know,” Corvan said.
								“The Ruthgari have beenwithdrawing early. It’s a skeleton crew now, so they make sure
								they all getout of the city before Garadul attacks. Why should they fight to save
								thecity for the Parians?”“Bastards,” Gavin grunted.“And cowards and opportunists.”
								Corvan shrugged. “What do youintend to do about it?”“I intend to hold this city.”“And
								how do you hope to do that?” Corvan asked.“Put someone in charge who’s an experienced
								hand at lost causes,”
							</p>

							<p>
								Gavin said.
							</p>

							<p>
								A pause, then Corvan raised his hands. “Oh, no. You can’t. It’simpossible. Lord Prism,
								I’m the enemy general!”“And since when don’t the conquered sometimes join the
								victor’sarmy?” Gavin asked.“Not as generals. Not right away.”“It’s been sixteen years.
								You’re a special case,” Gavin said. “Corvan
							</p>

							<p>
								Danavis, held in high esteem by both sides of the False Prism’s War. Theman who ended
								the war honorably. A man of unimpeachable integrity andintelligence. It has been a long
								time, why could people not believe that wehad put it all behind us?”“Because I’m the one
								who put that scar on your temple, and you werenone too happy about it. And Gavin’s men
								killed my wife.”
							</p>

							<p>
								Gavin’s brow wrinkled. “There is that.”“You don’t need me,” Corvan said. “You’re no
								slouch at command, Lord
							</p>

							<p>
								Prism.”
							</p>

							<p>
								It was true. Gavin had seen good leadership and practiced it enough toknow his own
								abilities. He also knew his weaknesses. “With equal armiesand terrain and me without
								magic, who would win between us, Corvan?”
							</p>

							<p>
								Corvan shrugged. “If you had a good cadre of support staff, and yourfield commanders
								would tell you the truth, I think—”“Corvan, I’m the Prism. Men don’t tell me the truth.
								I ask them, can youdo this? And they say yes, no matter what. They want to think
								therighteousness of obeying the Prism himself will magically help themovercome any
								obstacle. When I ask for objections to my most flawed plans,
							</p>

							<p>
								I get silence. It took months and several disasters to get our armies evenhalfway past
								that back in the war. We don’t have that time now.” It took acertain kind of mind to
								understand exactly how each branch of his forceswould react, what kind of combat
								situations they could handle and whatones they would buckle under. Gavin was good at
								that. He was good atjudging enemy commanders, especially those he’d met, and figuring
								outwhat they might do.
							</p>

							<p>
								But making snap judgments about the disposition of enemy forces fromfragmentary scouts’
								reports and getting thousands of men in variousbranches into position was something else
								entirely. Splitting your forces andgetting them to take different paths to an objective,
								each under its owncommander, and having them arrive simultaneously—that was a skill
								veryfew men had. Instilling discipline in men to continue maneuvering duringthe battle
								itself, for men to disengage right now when they could kill theiropponent with just one
								more thrust, and to get men to communicate so linescould open just a second before a
								cavalry charge came through the ranksthemselves—that was almost impossible. Gavin was
								good at men andmagic. Corvan understood numbers and time and tactics. And sixteen
								yearsago, he’d certainly been Gavin’s master in the art of deception. Together,they’d
								been unstoppable.“Of course, Rask did massacre my village.” Corvan said
								itdispassionately. He wasn’t working through his fury at losing everyone heknew; he was
								working through the story people would tell: I thought thePrism and General Danavis
								hated each other! They do, but the Prismneeded a general, and Danavis’s village was just
								butchered by KingGaradul, he wants revenge.
							</p>

							<p>
								It worked. It would seem odd, but not incredible. It had been sixteenyears.“So we’re
								both using each other,” Gavin said. “I need your tacticalgenius, you need my army to
								effect your revenge. I could check in on youopenly, making it clear I didn’t quite trust
								you.”“I could grumble about slights in front of the men. Nothing toundermine their
								confidence, but enough to make it clear I wasn’tcomfortable with you.”“It could
								work.”“It could,” Corvan said. He turned from looking at the bay. “Deceptioncomes
								quickly to you these days.”“Too much practice,” Gavin said, sobered from his initial joy
								at thechance to work with his friend once more. “You know, if this works, we canbe
								friends again in a year or two. Even in public.”“Unless I can serve you better as your
								enemy, Lord Prism.”“I’ve got enough of those. But fair enough. Now I’ve got a surprise
								foryou.”“A surprise?” Corvan asked, dubious.“I can’t be seen giving you something you
								enjoy, so you’ll have to godownstairs without me. The room directly below this one.”
								They steppedback toward the counsel room, but Gavin stopped. “How is she?”
							</p>

							<p>
								Corvan knew who he was talking about and what he really meant.“Karris once seemed like a
								wilting flower, bowing to her father’s everycommand. And she became a Blackguard, the
								White’s left hand. If anyonecan make it, she will.”
							</p>

							<p>
								Gavin took a deep breath and, masks of seriousness and distrustreplaced, they stepped
								into the counsel room. Commander Ironfist hadalready returned. He stood by the main
								doors in the loose, casual readinessof a man who spent much of his life guarding,
								waiting, watching. He wasaccustomed to inactivity and prepared for violence.“Commander,”
								Gavin said. “Corvan Danavis and I find ourselves with acommon enemy. He has agreed to
								help us coordinate Garriston’s defenses.Please notify the men that they will be overseen
								by General Danavis,effective immediately. The general will answer only to me. General,
								youcan take it from there?”
							</p>

							<p>
								Corvan looked like a man who’d swallowed vinegary wine and hewasn’t doing a good job of
								hiding the fact. “Yes, my Lord Prism.”
							</p>

							<p>
								Gavin waved his hand in dismissal. Abrupt, slightly imperious. Let
							</p>

							<p>
								Commander Ironfist take it as Gavin asserting his dominance. Corvan’s jawtightened, but
								he bowed and left.
							</p>

							<p>
								Go, my friend, and may finding your daughter repay a tiny measure ofthe misery you’ve
								endured because of me.
							</p>

							<p>
								Chapter 61“Will is what makes the Chromeria scary, even for us,” Liv said. The sunwas
								just touching the horizon outside, and room slaves entered as if on cueand began
								lighting lamps and a fire.“Who is this Will, and how do we stop him?” Kip asked.“Kip.”
								Liv tilted her head down. “Focus.”“Sorry, go ahead.” She was ignoring the room slaves,
								so Kip tried to doso as well.“Will is just what you think it is. You impose your will on
								the world.
							</p>

							<p>
								You will magic to happen. Will can cover over the gaps in flawed drafting.That’s
								especially important for flailers.”“Flailers?”“All men drafters and the half of the
								women drafters who aren’tsuperchromats,” Liv said. She paused. “Well, most men, huh?”
							</p>

							<p>
								The term was a bit nasty, really. A little bit, We’re better than you are,you helpless
								hacks. You try, we succeed. But that was how the Chromeriaworked, wasn’t it? Everything
								was about power and dominance. “Right,”Kip said, “flailers. Those sad sacks. Pitiful.”
								Even if Kip found himself inthe elite group, it didn’t mean he had to like how the
								others were demeaned.
							</p>

							<p>
								Liv flushed and shot back, “Look, Kip, you don’t have to like it, but youhave to deal
								with it. And you’ll probably do better if you don’t have a chipon your shoulder about
								everything. It’s not like back home. Because guesswhat? We don’t have a home now. The
								Chromeria is all we get, and we’vegot it good. So grow up.”
							</p>

							<p>
								It was like he’d been slapped. She was right, but he hadn’t expected somuch vehemence
								out of nowhere. He averted his eyes. “Right. Sorry.”
							</p>

							<p>
								She expelled a breath. “No, I’m sorry. That… I don’t know… I guess
							</p>

							<p>
								I’m still adjusting to this whole life myself. There’s a hierarchy toeverything at the
								Chromeria, Kip, and it’s not easy to adjust to. I don’t evenknow if it’s good to adjust
								to it. But once you know your place, you canfigure out how you’re supposed to deal with
								everyone else, even people youdon’t know. It does simplify things. I just—after the last
								three years as amonochrome in an obscure color, and a Tyrean on top of that, I never
								likedthe whole hierarchy. But I’d finally come to terms with my place in it, and Iwas
								almost finished with my training and ready to head out into my shittylife. Now I’m a
								bichrome and everything’s different, overnight. I’m goingto have to stay at the
								Chromeria for another couple of years, and my lifewill be totally different. People see
								me now.” She smiled ruefully, sadly. “Iguess you know all about having everything change
								in a blink. The thing is,I like my new life. I have new clothes, jewelry, an allowance.
								A room slave.I guess what I’m seeing is that maybe I didn’t hate the hierarchy, maybe
								Ijust hated being at the bottom of it. So every time I enjoy something, it feelslike
								confirmation that I’m a hypocrite.”“I’ll promise to make your life as difficult as
								possible, if it’ll make youhappy,” Kip said.
							</p>

							<p>
								She hit his shoulder playfully, but it nailed a sensitive spot. “You’re areal lifesaver,
								Kip.” She grinned, though, as he rubbed his shoulder. Thenher smile faded again. “I
								guess I should take my own advice and startdealing with how things are. You’re the
								Prism’s son, I’m your tutor. Ishouldn’t hit you. Orholam, you’re the Prism’s son, how
								dare I?”
							</p>

							<p>
								Kip’s chest tightened. “No!” he almost shouted. The room slaves shotlooks at him. He
								lowered his voice, embarrassed. “Liv, swear to me youwon’t. I—”
							</p>

							<p>
								What were you going to say, Kip? I’ve been in love with you since I canremember?
								Right.“I couldn’t bear losing my last anchor to Rekton,” he said instead, all thewords
								tripping over each other. “You’re the only one who knew me beforeall this.”
							</p>

							<p>
								Great, good job making it seem like it’s totally impersonal. I don’t careabout you, I
								just care about Rekton.“I mean… Liv, you know me, you’re—” You’re my friend? That
								soundsa little presumptuous, doesn’t it? What if she’s never thought of you as
								afriend?“You’re from Rekton, too,” he said instead, lamely. Impersonal again.
							</p>

							<p>
								Damn! “I need someone to talk to, and I’ve always… admired you.”
							</p>

							<p>
								Admired? Like she’s a painting?“I mean, I appreciate—”Appreciate. Kind of the same as
								admire, isn’t it? Like she’s a goodcook?
							</p>

							<p>
								Orholam’s balls, this is agony! Ah, a way out! Not appreciate her, butappreciate how she
								does something.“I appreciate how you—” How she whats?How she looks in that one too-small
								green shirt she used to—shit!“—have always been so nice to me.”Now you’re the pleading,
								awkward child again. Well done. Kip Silver
							</p>

							<p>
								Tongue, they ought to call you.
							</p>

							<p>
								I’m never going to speak to another woman again.Kip could barely stand to look at Liv
								after that performance, but shewaited until he met her eyes, leery.“Why, Kip, are you
								flirting with me?!” she asked.It was like Kip had stepped into that nightmare where he
								walked to the
							</p>

							<p>
								Midsummer’s Dance on the green, barely registering the curious glancesuntil he stepped
								up on the stage and the music stopped, every dancer missedtheir steps, and everyone
								turned to look at him. And then he noticed he wasnaked. And then everyone started
								laughing. Pointing. Making jokes.
							</p>

							<p>
								No, this was worse. He wasn’t going to wake from this. All the bloodhad drained from his
								face. Evernight, it had drained from everywhere. Hehad no idea where it had all gone,
								but it had taken his ability to speak withit.“Kip, I’m kidding,” Liv said.His mouth
								moved. Blood coming back. Thoughts slower.“Not often that you’re left with nothing to
								say,” Liv said, poking him.
							</p>

							<p>
								His thoughts on that must have shown, because she smirked. “If you don’twatch it, I’ll
								ruffle your hair.”“That’s it, I’m shaving my head!” Kip declared.Liv laughed. “Enough,
								enough! No more digressions! I’ll never teachyou anything if we keep on like this.”“So,”
								Kip said, “will. Not the bad man. See? At least I remember wherewe got off track.”
							</p>

							<p>
								Liv shook her head, amused. “Not so fast. First, Kip, you’ve got a deal.
							</p>

							<p>
								I’d love to be your friend. Maybe we can remind each other every now andagain where we
								came from.”
							</p>

							<p>
								Kip felt his ears getting hot. As if they’d ever cooled. “I’d like that alot,” he
								said.“Now, finally, will. Will covers a multitude of flaws, just as—”“Love covers a
								multitude of sins,” a familiar voice declared from thedoor.
							</p>

							<p>
								Both Kip’s and Liv’s heads snapped around. It was Master Danavis,
							</p>

							<p>
								Liv’s father, alive.“Father? Father!” Liv literally shrieked. She jumped up and ran to
								herfather and threw herself into his arms. Corvan laughed and squeezed herhard.“I heard
								you were dead!” Liv said.Um, yes, that was me. Kip, bringer of false bad tidings. “I
								didn’t believeit, but I was so—” Liv started crying.
							</p>

							<p>
								Corvan closed his eyes, just holding his daughter. Kip wondered if therewere some way he
								could escape.
							</p>

							<p>
								And go where? This is my room.But after a few moments, Corvan gently pushed his daughter
								back. “Iam surprisingly durable. You look more lovely than ever, Aliviana.”“I’m all
								cryey,” Liv protested, wiping her eyes.“Perhaps even a smidge more beautiful than your
								mother. A claim I’dnot have tolerated until this day, seeing the truth with my own eyes.
								She’dbe so proud of you.”“Father,” Liv said, her cheeks coloring, but pleased.“Don’t you
								think she’s beautiful, Kip?”Kip spluttered, making some kind of sound like he was
								drowning.
							</p>

							<p>
								Seriously, if embarrassment were a muscle, I’d be huge.“Faather!” Liv said,
								horrified.Corvan laughed. “My day wouldn’t have been complete without mydaughter
								thinking I was embarrassing. Your pardon, Kip.”“Erm,” Kip said eloquently. So he hadn’t
								been the target after all. Livhad. Kip was seeing where she got her wicked sense of
								humor.“It’s wonderful to see you well, Kip… Kip Guile.” Corvan shook hishead, astounded.
								“Liv, Kip, I’d love to catch up with you both, but thePrism has just given me
								work.”“Work?” Liv asked.“I’ve been put in charge of the defense of Garriston, under only
								the
							</p>

							<p>
								Prism himself.”“What?!” Liv said. “You’re a general again?”“Not as enviable a position
								as you might think. A softer bed doesn’tmake for easier sleep when ten thousand lives
								rest in your shaking hands.King Garadul’s army will be here in about five days. They’ll
								attack the dayafter Midsummer’s. If we’re to hold this city, I’ll have to devise a
								morebrilliant defense than I’ve ever seen. I need to go set some things in motionnow,
								but Liv, I’ll come find you sometime after midnight. Kip, maybetomorrow?”“I’d like that,
								Master Danavis. General Danavis?”Master Danavis smiled. “Yes. Hadn’t noticed how much
								I’d missed that.
							</p>

							<p>
								Despite everything. Say, Liv, do you know anything about Karris WhiteOak?”
							</p>

							<p>
								Liv shrugged. “Only Blood Forester Blackguard, astounding fighter,bichrome who was
								nearly a poly, maybe the fastest drafter on the Jaspers.Why?”
							</p>

							<p>
								The new general said, “She was captured by King Garadul. The Prismwon’t admit it, but I
								know it’s going to drive him to distraction. He cares agreat deal about her. I doubt it
								will be possible to rescue her, not with thelimited assets I have, but I’m going to
								learn all I can to see if there’s anyhope at all.”
							</p>

							<p>
								And just like that, a stupid, mad, impossible idea took root.
							</p>

							<p>
								Chapter 62“Wake up, Kip,” a voice said.
							</p>

							<p>
								Kip was usually a heavy sleeper, but he sat upright instantly at thatvoice. “My Lord
								Prism?” he asked, blinking. It felt like it had barely beenten minutes since he went to
								bed.
							</p>

							<p>
								Gavin said, “Get dressed. We’re going for a walk.” He turned toward
							</p>

							<p>
								Commander Ironfist, who was standing by the door. “You’re invited.”
							</p>

							<p>
								A grin flashed over Ironfist’s face, visible only because his teeth were sostarkly white
								against his ebony skin. He would have accompanied themregardless.
							</p>

							<p>
								Kip pulled on his clothes. Within minutes, they were walking the streetsof Garriston.
								Kip was playing his part of the gawker once more, still a littleoverwhelmed by being in
								a city of this size, despite that it wasn’t nearly asimpressive as the Jaspers. The
								construction, of course, wasn’t all toweringminarets. Like back home, the buildings were
								square, with flat roofs wherepeople could relax in the evenings or sleep during the
								unbearably hotnights. Even with the sea breezes, it got stiflingly hot here. But
								thebuildings here weren’t solely the stone construction that was used inRekton.
								Interspersed with the stone, often on the same building, were mudbricks and date palm
								wood, all stuck together with gypsum mortar. Even thewhitewash, helpful in cooling homes
								and preserving the mortar and mudbricks from the sun, was applied haphazardly. The
								buildings were, however,three and four stories tall. Only a few buildings in Rekton rose
								to threestories. People in the streets looked dirty, and there was garbageeverywhere.
							</p>

							<p>
								Gavin, Kip noticed, was wearing a worn, faded cloak with a singlebutton holding it
								closed in front. Disguising his status? Indeed, CommanderIronfist was getting more
								stares than either Kip or Gavin.“Hey, Ironfist, you think you could be a little less
								conspicu—” Gavinstarted, then traced his eyes from Ironfist’s feet up, until he had to
								tilt hishead back to take in the huge, hugely muscled man. “Never mind.”
							</p>

							<p>
								Kip smiled. “Where are we going?” he asked.“You’ll see,” Gavin said. “How are your
								studies?”“I don’t know that anything I’ve done yet counts as studying,” Kip said.
							</p>

							<p>
								He scrunched his face. “Liv was barely beginning to explain how drafters’dependence on
								will makes for a lot of dangerous men when her father camein.”“What’d she say?”“Well,
								nothing. I didn’t really understand it, and she didn’t get thechance to explain.”
							</p>

							<p>
								Gavin turned into an alley to help them bypass the crowded streetssurrounding the water
								market. “Very few men are superchromats, Kip. EvenI’m not a superchromat, though Dazen
								was, so apparently it runs in thefamily. If you want to draft something that will
								endure, you have to draftthe exact middle of the spectrum you’re working with. You want
								to make ablue sword that will last years after you draft it? It has to be perfect, and
								ofcourse, you have to keep it out of light, but that’s a different topic. Becausemen,
								aside from the few exceptions, can’t do that—can’t draft in the exactmiddle of a color,
								not can’t keep it out of the light, obviously. Ahem, that is,if men want to make
								anything permanent, they have to add will. Makes itsound like it’s meat you add to a
								stew, doesn’t it? Hmm. I don’t teach much,obviously. Let me try this.” Gavin appeared
								perfectly heedless of the darkcorners they were passing and the acquisitive eyes that
								followed them. Butthen, once any acquisitive eyes alit on Ironfist, they found other
								things tostudy in a hurry.“Every time you draft, you use your will. You have to decide
								thatsomething totally outlandish, weird, unnatural-seeming is going to happen,and you’re
								going to make it happen. In other words, you decide to domagic. Now, the more outlandish
								it is, the harder it is to believe you canreally do it. Or to put it another way, the
								more will it takes. You with me?”“Makes sense so far,” Kip said.“Good. Now, blue sword.”
								Gavin lifted a hand from beneath his cloak.
							</p>

							<p>
								His hand was solid blue, and as Kip watched, blue luxin blossomed from it.Gelled,
								solidified, hardened into the form of a blue sword. Gavin handed itto Kip.
							</p>

							<p>
								Kip took it, feeling self-conscious as they passed through an intersectionwith another
								alley and he was bearing the blade like he was following it tohis destiny. “Uh,” he
								said, but then he felt the hilt go slippery. A momentlater, the blade drooped, broke off
								the hilt of its own weight, and splatted onthe dirty cobblestones of the alley. There
								was a light shimmer of blue, andthen nothing but blue dust. The same happened moments
								later to the hilt inKip’s hand, leaving only that gritty blue dust.“What’s the dust?”
								Kip asked.“A later lesson,” Gavin said. “I’m having trouble teaching the basics asit is.
								The point for you is to imagine I’d drafted you a plow instead of asword. Great, it
								works while the drafter is at your farm, but ten minutesafter he leaves, all you’ve got
								is dust, literally. Not helpful. This is whysuperchromats are heavily recruited by all
								satrapies.”“So they can make plows?”“Not all magic is for fun and dismemberment, Kip. In
								fact, most draftersspend their whole lives doing practical things like making plows. For
								everyartist, there’s ten men who repair roofs with green luxin. Anyway, men—and the
								women who aren’t lucky enough to be superchromats—can covertheir failings with
								will.”“You mean just by trying harder.”“Pretty much.”“That doesn’t sound so bad. So they
								try harder. Liv was making menamong drafters sound like slaves compared to the
								freeborn.”“More like dogs, I’d say,” Gavin said.“Huh?”“Well, they are second-class
								because using will constantly wears you.
							</p>

							<p>
								It’s exhausting. And will isn’t just effort, it’s belief and effort together. So ifyou
								need belief to do magic, what happens to the man who loses all hisbelief in himself?”“He
								can’t do magic?” Kip guessed.“Exactly. That’s half of what all the hierarchy among
								drafters is about.
							</p>

							<p>
								Satraps and satrapahs treat drafters like they’re Orholam’s gift to the worldnot just
								because they are Orholam’s gift, but because if the drafter doesn’tbelieve he’s special
								and you call on him to do magic, he won’t be able to doit. Drafter who can’t draft?
								Useless.”“I never thought of that.” So the rigid hierarchy wasn’t simply becausethey
								could? Kip guessed that this wasn’t the way Liv’s tutors had explainedthings to her.“Of
								course, it’s a circle that spirals on itself. You’re a satrap, you’ve paida fortune for
								a bichrome drafter, well, now you’ve invested so much in himthat you can’t afford for
								him to fail you, so you have to reinforce hisfeelings of superiority and pamper him,
								give him slaves and so forth. Itmakes the more powerful drafters more and more difficult
								to manage.”
							</p>

							<p>
								There was a cough from behind them. Ironfist.“Commander,” Gavin asked, “you have
								something to add to thisdiscussion?”“Little dust in my throat. Apologies,” Ironfist
								said, sounding not at allapologetic.“Problem with will is, we think that the more will a
								man or womanexpends in their life, the faster they die. Or it could merely be that men
								orwomen with great will tend to draft a lot more. Either way, their careers
								arespectacular. And short. It’s probably why male drafters don’t tend to live aslong as
								women do, expending will all the time in order to have theirdrafting be useful. Side
								effect is that among the most powerful drafters, wehave a lot of people with titanic
								will. Or, to put it bluntly, a lot of arrogantassholes. Especially the men. And madmen.
								Delusional people tend tobelieve in what they’re doing. Makes them powerful.”“So I’m
								going to be spending my time with crazy, arrogant bastards.”“Well, many of them are of
								the finest blood.”Oh, that’s right, I’m the only bastard around here. “I thought being
								adrafter was going to be fun,” Kip said.“Grunts never get to scull,” Gavin
								said.“Grunts?”“Grunts, mundies, norms, grubbers, clods, shovelslingers, blinders,dulls,
								scrubs, mouth breathers, slumps, the benighted—there’s lots ofnames. Most of them not as
								nice as those. They all mean the same thing:non-drafters.”“So what about you?” Kip
								asked, as they finally left the alleys. Theycrossed a wide, peaked stone bridge over the
								Umber River.
							</p>

							<p>
								Gavin looked at him. “You mean what nasty names do they call me?”“No!” Oh, Gavin was
								teasing. Kip scowled. “Your eyes don’t”—helooked for the right word—“halo. So does that
								mean you can draft as muchas you want?”“I tire like anyone, but yes. For a time I can
								draft every day as much as Ican handle and it won’t burn me out. Someday, most likely
								five years fromnow, I will start to lose colors. It will take about a year, and then
								I’ll die.”“Why five years from now?” Kip asked. It was still odd to him
								howmatter-of-fact drafters were about their impending deaths. I guess they havetime to
								get used to the idea.“It always happens on multiples of seven from when a Prism begins
								hisreign. I’ve made it sixteen years, so I have until twenty-one. Long time for
								aPrism.”“Oh. Why multiples of seven?”“Because there’s seven colors, seven virtues, seven
								satrapies? Because
							</p>

							<p>
								Orholam likes the number seven? Truth is, no one knows.”
							</p>

							<p>
								They walked on through streets swelling with people starting theirmorning errands, and
								those eager to get as much work done as possiblebefore the heat of the day. They
								approached a long line of workersbottlenecked at the Lover’s Gate, heading out to work
								outside the city.Though Kip didn’t even see him draft, Gavin turned and handed him
								agreen rock. Not a rock. Green luxin, perfectly the size to fit in Kip’s palm.Kip took
								it, confused.“You bring your specs?” Gavin asked. He handed Kip a square board,not a
								foot on each side, perfectly white.
							</p>

							<p>
								Kip produced them. Smiled weakly. I have a bad feeling about what he’sgoing to tell me
								next.“Your turn. You can have lunch—or dinner or possibly breakfast—whenyou make a green
								luxin ball of your own. You’ve got the spectacles, a whitereflector, plenty of sun, and
								an example. I couldn’t make it easier if I tried.”“But I need Skill, Will, Source, and
								Still. I don’t have skill. Any skill. Atall.”
							</p>

							<p>
								Gavin looked at him sardonically. “And how do you think you getskilled? Skill is the
								most overrated of the requisites. Will covers a multitudeof flaws.”
							</p>

							<p>
								I keep hearing that. Kip hadn’t even had breakfast, and he wasn’t goingto get to eat
								until he made a magic ball? Fantastic.
							</p>

							<p>
								They came upon the back of the line. Gavin glanced at Commander
							</p>

							<p>
								Ironfist. Without further prompting, Ironfist said, “Looks like a wagonbroke down. It’s
								blocking half the gate.”
							</p>

							<p>
								Gavin swept a hand forward, as in, You go first. Commander Ironfistwent first, and the
								impatient farmers and craftsman parted easily for him.Or at least those who looked
								furious at being pushed aside quickly hid itonce they saw the size of the man towering
								over them. “We’re going tohelp,” Gavin said.“Sure, you Parian scum,” someone said,
								spitting. Gavin stopped andscanned the crowd for who’d spoken. As men met his eyes and
								saw thoseprismatic orbs, they quieted, confused, stunned.“You can have my help, or you
								can have my enmity,” Gavin said loudly.
							</p>

							<p>
								He unbuttoned the nondescript cloak and threw it back over his shoulders,exposing the
								almost blindingly white coat and shirt he wore underneath,worked with gold thread and
								jewels.
							</p>

							<p>
								He walked on, and Kip scooted close to him. The crowd parted aroundthem, murmuring
								questions and imprecations. In a minute, they were at thefront of the line. At least a
								dozen men were straining to move a wagon.Apparently, the horses had spooked and veered
								to the side as they passedthrough the gate. The wagon’s wheel had smashed into the
								gate’s support—here actually the Lover’s hair. The wheel was completely shattered, as
								wasthe wagon’s axle, and the whole thing was still stuck against the wall,making normal
								efforts at repair impossible. The men were straining to liftthe wagon by sheer brute
								strength, with a few using long poles to try tocrank the mass off the wall.“We’re going
								to have to bring up an empty wagon and unload thisbefore we’ve got a chance,” one of the
								guards was saying.
							</p>

							<p>
								To Kip’s admittedly inexperienced eye, the man was right. Thecombined muscle of all
								these laborers was barely budging the wagon. Butthe assembled crowd groaned, a few
								complaining aloud.“Bring an empty wagon? From where? Through that whole mess behindus?
								It’ll take hours!”“You all are going to have to use the other gates today,” the guard
								said.That met similar protests. With how thickly crowded the street was,none of the men
								at the front of the line would be able to leave untileveryone at the back dispersed. It
								would take hours.“What?” the guard shouted. “I didn’t do this. I’m just trying to fix
								it!
							</p>

							<p>
								You have a better idea?”“I do,” Gavin said.“Oh, sure, you smart—Lord Prism!” the guard
								said.That sent a ripple of murmurs through the crowd.Gavin ignored it. He gestured to
								the men to step back. They did, some inawe, others more peeved, some hostile. He simply
								walked to where thewagon was smashed against the wall. “I see why you had trouble,” he
								said.“But I have a few extra tools available to me.”
							</p>

							<p>
								Kip, still holding his green luxin ball and the white board, realized
							</p>

							<p>
								Commander Ironfist had disappeared.
							</p>

							<p>
								He’s gigantic. How does he disappear? Kip looked around, and finallyfound him. The
								commander was standing behind a man in the crowd whosehand had dropped to the big work
								knife at his belt. Commander Ironfist’shuge hand enveloped both the man’s hand and his
								knife. The commanderhimself, towering over the man, was quietly speaking in his ear.
							</p>

							<p>
								As he spoke, the man’s face blanched and his whole body slackened.Commander Ironfist
								gave the man a friendly pounding on his shoulder—which nearly crushed him—and stepped
								back toward Gavin.“Always running off when I need you,” Gavin said.Commander Ironfist
								grunted.Kip couldn’t help himself. “I think he might have just saved your—” Hesaw the
								look on Gavin’s face belatedly. Gavin knew. “Oh. Um. Nevermind.” Clever Kip.
							</p>

							<p>
								But Gavin was back to work already. “I need ropes.” He held a hand upover his head and a
								bar of yellow luxin formed in his hand and snapped outin both directions, until it was
								three times the height of a man. He handed itto one of the stunned workers. “You and
								you, get this in position, I’ll needyou to lever the wagon off the wall.”
							</p>

							<p>
								The man bobbed his head. He and the other man started jamming thepole as deep between
								the wall and wagon as they could.
							</p>

							<p>
								Gavin walked as far around the wagon as he could, sending out thin jetsof luxin in a
								number of places under the axles. “Now,” he told the men withthe lever.
							</p>

							<p>
								They strained and moved the wagon less than a hand’s breadth. After athree count, they
								relaxed and set their shoulders to try again.“Not necessary,” Gavin said. “You gave me
								enough already. Well done.”
							</p>

							<p>
								And indeed, there was luxin even behind the wagon, encasing the whole ina shimmering web
								of various colors, mostly greens and yellows.
							</p>

							<p>
								Gavin rolled his shoulders, braced himself, pointed at the arching luxin-and-stone of
								the gate, and shot out a stream of blue and yellow. In moments,it congealed into a
								pulley. He took coils of rope from a nearby farmer andshot out another bolt, anchoring
								one end of the rope to the ceiling. Then hethreaded the rest of the rope through the
								pulley. He pulled some slack intothe rope between the fixed pulley and the attached end
								and drafted a free-rolling pulley onto that, which he then fixed to the web of luxin
								around thewagon. He beckoned the farmer, apparently the wagon’s owner, and tossedhim the
								rest of the rope. “It’ll still take all of you helping,” he said.
							</p>

							<p>
								Kip swallowed. “Please tell me he isn’t designing those off the top of hishead,” he said
								to Commander Ironfist, who was silently watching thecrowd.“He’s not. You’d be surprised
								how often wagons break down when yourarmy is pursuing another army across half the Seven
								Satrapies. I’ve seenhim lift heavier loads by himself. Albeit with lots more pulleys.”
							</p>

							<p>
								Which meant the real question was why Gavin didn’t just do thishimself. He could draft
								luxin better than any hemp rope. He could draftanother four pulleys and make the burden
								so light he could lift the wagonhimself. But as soon as Kip asked himself, he knew.
								Gavin was buildingrapport with the townsfolk. If he marched in and did it all himself,
								they’d beawed, but they’d not be a part of it. This way, he was simply enabling themto
								help themselves. His power might still be awesome, but it was power inservice of them.
							</p>

							<p>
								The men heaved on the lines, and Gavin called some men to him. As thewagon lifted off
								the ground it swung away from the wall, and Gavin and afew others braced it so it didn’t
								swing wildly and hurt anyone. Finally theystabilized the swinging, and Gavin shouted,
								“Okay, hold it there!” Then heslid under the wagon, scooting on his back under the
								broken back axle.
							</p>

							<p>
								That was no light wagon, and the men were straining to hold the load—these men of a city
								Gavin’s army had nearly obliterated sixteen years ago.And yet Commander Ironfist didn’t
								seem perturbed.“Aren’t you worried they’ll drop it on purpose?” Kip whispered.“No.”
							</p>

							<p>
								Kip was. But Gavin appeared unafraid. He grabbed the ends of thebroken axle and brought
								them together as close as he could. It was no use,they were twisted and bent, but Gavin
								brought them as close as he couldand then bound them by degrees with yellow. The wagon
								wheel followed inshort order. He repaired what he could, and replaced what he couldn’t.
							</p>

							<p>
								He scooted out and gestured. The men lowered the wagon and it settledon the road, easily
								taking the weight. A shout of triumph went up fromthose who’d been helping. Gavin
								clapped the farmer on the shoulder.“Those’ll be good for about three days, then you’ll
								need to get real repairs,but it’ll hold you until then.”“Thank you, sir, thank you ever
								so much. I thought they were going tolynch me for sure. A day’s lost wages for all these
								men. You’ve saved me,sir.”
							</p>

							<p>
								Gavin smiled and said, “You’re welcome. Now get those horses hitchedup.”
							</p>

							<p>
								Only as he saw the smiles did Kip understand fully what Gavin haddone. With ten minutes
								of effort and a little subtlety, he had turned anannoyance into an opportunity to win
								over not just the men he’d helped, butall those to whom they would repeat the story. The
								incongruity of the Prismhimself joining in the starkly physical labor of lifting and
								moving andstabilizing the wagon, heedless of soiling his expensive white
								clothing,joining them muscle to muscle, communicated something to these men. Aruler who
								would sweat with them was a ruler who might understand menwho won their bread by the
								sweat of their brow. That man was easier totrust than some dandy in silks who might be
								all kinds of noble-smart butdidn’t know the real world.“It’s why you hardly ever hear
								anyone call him Emperor Guile,” Ironfistsaid quietly, reading Kip’s mind. “At heart,
								he’s not an emperor; he’s apromachos. It’s not always the best way to fight, but it’s
								his only way. It’swhy men will die for him.”“Why didn’t he stay promachos, then?” Kip
								asked, wondering if it was adangerous question.“I could list a dozen reasons. Truth is,
								I don’t know.”With a gesture—completely for show, of course—Gavin released all theluxin
								and it dissolved, shimmering, until it was nothing but dust. He noddedto his fellow
								laborers and then gestured Kip to follow.
							</p>

							<p>
								As Kip joined Gavin and walked through the gate, Gavin said, “Youhave that green luxin
								ball for me yet?”“What?” Kip protested. “I can’t believe—I didn’t even have a chance—”
							</p>

							<p>
								Oh. He got me again. Gavin was grinning.“Look, Kip,” Kip said, “gullible’s written on
								the sky!” He gazed up as ifclueless. “Huh? Where?”
							</p>

							<p>
								Gavin laughed, and if Kip didn’t misjudge, he thought even Ironfist wassmiling. “A
								little slow at the starting line, but watch out when he picks upspeed. Reminds me of
								someone.” His smirk told Kip the someone washimself. He put his hand on Kip’s shoulder.
							</p>

							<p>
								Kip felt a thousand things he couldn’t identify at that touch. That touchclaimed him:
								That’s my boy, it said. His mother had said those words a fewtimes—always after Kip
								messed up. She’d never said them with pride.
							</p>

							<p>
								Gavin Guile wasn’t just a great man. He was a good man. Kip would doanything for him.
							</p>

							<p>
								Chapter 63“General, I need to speak with you.” Liv Danavis had found her father onthe
								roof of the Travertine Palace, checklists and reports spread all over atable. It wasn’t
								yet dawn, and he was bundled against the chill of themorning. He was standing, ignoring
								his work for the moment, his buttagainst the edge of his table, looking toward the
								east.“ ‘General’ this morning, not ‘father.’ I must be in trouble,” he said. Thecorners
								of his mouth twitched. “Come here.”
							</p>

							<p>
								She came to his side and he pulled her close so they could watch the sunrise
								together.“Moments of beauty sustain us through hours of ugliness,” her fathersaid. She
								watched him as he watched the sun rise. His blue eyes—outsidethe red halo, of
								course—looked tired. Corvan Danavis had always had thecapacity to survive on less sleep
								than anyone Liv knew, so she knew itwasn’t the early hour that had him weary. It wasn’t
								the first time she’d seenthis look on his face, but she thought it might be the first
								time sheunderstood it.
							</p>

							<p>
								All those times she’d seen this look pinching his eyes and squeezing thejoy out of her
								usually jovial father, he was reliving battles. Today, he waspreparing to see more men
								die—and fighting for the very man who’d killedhis people in the past, Gavin Guile. It
								must be tearing him apart.
							</p>

							<p>
								The sun rose in magnificent pinks and oranges mirrored in the waves,and slowly the
								tension leaked out of her father’s eyes. She could see thefreckles under his caramel
								skin around his eyes, and the faint red highlightsin his hair were set afire by the
								sunlight. She’d inherited neither, nor theblue eyes that would have helped her be a more
								powerful drafter.
							</p>

							<p>
								Corvan’s lips moved faintly, mouthing words. Oh, he was praying, sherealized. Finished,
								he made the triangle, splaying three fingers: touching histhumb to his right eye; his
								middle finger to his left eye; and his forefinger tohis forehead, the spiritual eye. He
								completed the gesture by touchingmouth, heart, and hands. The three and the four, the
								perfect seven, sealed toOrholam. What you behold, what you believe, how you behave.
							</p>

							<p>
								He didn’t turn from the risen sun. “You came to demand how I can fightfor my old enemy,”
								he said.“He killed mother.” Liv’s voice was icy.“No, Aliviana, he didn’t.”“His people
								did. Same thing.”“The situation is more complicated than you realize.”“What’s that
								supposed to mean? Don’t treat me like I’m a child!”“I’m sorry, Aliviana, I have to
								protect—”“I’m seventeen. I’ve been surviving without your protection for threeyears! You
								don’t have to protect me anymore.”“Not protecting you,” Corvan said. “Protecting others
								from you.”What? It hit Liv like a shot in the stomach. Her father didn’t trust her?“You
								know who was seventeen when he upended the world?” Corvanasked. “Dazen
								Guile.”“But—but—that’s not even close to the same thing.”“Aliviana, I’m asking you to
								trust me. I’ve seen fathers who abuse theirposition and demand slavish obedience of
								their children. I’ve never donethat with you, have I? When you wanted to go to the
								Chromeria and I didn’twant you to go, when I told you that I could teach you everything
								aboutdrafting you needed to know, what happened?”“You let me go.” Eventually.“And it was
								awful for you there, but you showed me how strong youare, and here you stand. I’m proud
								of you, Aliviana. You swam with seademons and survived. But I’m asking you to trust me
								on this. I’m doing theright thing. I promise. I haven’t forgotten your mother. I haven’t
								forgottenyou.”
							</p>

							<p>
								She couldn’t maintain the eye contact or her righteous indignation in theface of her
								father’s open, honest refusal to be more open and honest. Hewas standing on his record,
								and more than anyone, she knew that his recordwas unimpeachable. She also knew that he
								wouldn’t be moved once hemade a decision like this. If she was stubborn, she’d come by
								it honestly.
							</p>

							<p>
								She gave in. “It was so much easier to admire him when he wasn’tmaking war in our
								country. I mean, I didn’t even think about the war when Iwas around him.”“A little
								infatuated?” her father suggested.A flush crawled up her cheeks. “Maybe a little,” she
								grumbled.“I’d wonder if you weren’t. He is what he is,” Corvan said, shrugging.“He
								really isn’t responsible for mother’s death?” Liv asked, feelingweak.“Responsible?
								That’s tricky. If the Guiles hadn’t gone to war, wouldyour mother still be alive?
								Probably. But I can tell you two things: Gavindidn’t order or desire your mother’s death
								in any way, and he is utterly andforever besotted with one woman, and that’s not
								you.”“That’s three things, isn’t it?” Liv asked, shooting her father a grin.He grinned
								back. “You get one free for being my daughter.”“What’s he doing here? The Prism’s men
								burned this city, killed tens ofthousands. He’s showed no interest in Garriston since
								then, so what does hewant now? Like it didn’t matter when no one wanted it, but now
								thatsomeone does, he can’t lose it?”“There weren’t two Guile brothers, there were three.
								The youngest one,
							</p>

							<p>
								Sevastian, was murdered by a blue wight when Gavin was about thirteen.Gavin’s first
								purpose is to protect the innocent from color wights. Or, if youwant to look at it
								uncharitably, to kill color wights wherever he finds them.King Garadul is using color
								wights, or at least the Prism believes he is. Sohe must be stopped.”“A blue wight? That
								doesn’t make sense. Blues are rational, aren’tthey?”“Liv, people talk about breaking the
								halo like you go instantly mad, likeit’s as clean a separation as between living and
								dying. It’s not. Some colorwights hold on to something like sanity for weeks or even
								months. Someare fine during the night, but in light, they’re fully in the grip of their
								color.The madness is different every time. A blue can go into a murderous rage; ared can
								seem calm and philosophical. It’s why they’re so dangerous. Now,are you going to help
								me?”“Fine, what can I do?” she asked.“Do you know how to make luxin grenadoes?”“What?
								No.”“What are they teaching you dims at the Chromeria these days?”“Hey!”Corvan smiled.
								“You have your specs?”“Of course,” Liv said.“Good, I could use a yellow.”“I’m not a very
								good yellow. I mean, I can’t make a solid brightwater.”“That’s not what I need,” Corvan
								said. “Do you know what happenswhen you mix red and liquid yellow, seal it airtight in a
								blue shell, and thenshatter it against something?”“Uh, something good?” Liv
								asked.“Boom!” Corvan said. “You could use superviolet for the shell, too, butit makes
								throwers nervous.”
							</p>

							<p>
								Picking up an explosive when you couldn’t see whether the shell wasintact? Liv could see
								how that might make someone nervous.
							</p>

							<p>
								Corvan tossed her a blue luxin ball. She caught it and was surprised thatit rattled. She
								looked closer. The ball had round shot inside it, like smallmusket balls. For some
								reason, it stunned her. “These, these…”“Those are what make grenadoes kill. That’s what
								we’re doing,
							</p>

							<p>
								Aliviana. We’re killing people. Right here, right now. We’re usingOrholam’s gift to kill
								Orholam’s children. Most of whom are fools whocould be our friends at any other time.
								It’s a hard world. You want me to lieabout it? You want to be protected after all?”
							</p>

							<p>
								Liv felt the blood drain out of her. Her father’s words were a sponge,sucking up her
								illusions, blotting up the thin joy she’d gotten from being inhis presence again, in
								trusting someone to make her decisions for her.Something snapped.“Father, I can’t do
								this,” she said. “I can’t kill Tyreans, not for the
							</p>

							<p>
								Chromeria, not just because you say so.”
							</p>

							<p>
								For a moment, she saw keen sorrow in her father’s eyes. He looked—forthe first time
								she’d ever seen in her whole life—old, haggard. “Liv.” Hepaused. “At some point, you
								have to decide not merely what you’re goingto believe, but how you’re going to believe.
								Are you going to believe inpeople, or in ideas, or in Orholam? With your heart, or with
								your head? Willyou believe what’s in front of you, or in what you think you know?
								Thereare some things you think you know that are lies. I can’t tell you what thoseare,
								and I’m sorry for that.”
							</p>

							<p>
								It seemed to Liv that this was his long way of explaining Fealty to One.“What did you
								choose, father? Ideas or men?” Liv asked. Though shehad just seen him praying, she knew
								her father wasn’t very religious. Thatpart of him had died with her mother. His prayer
								had likely been somethingalong the lines of: “Well done, sir. This is a beautiful
								sunset.” Her fatherrejected the idea that Orholam actually cared about individual men
								orwomen, or nations, for that matter.
							</p>

							<p>
								She saw him blink. His mouth opened, closed rapidly. Set in a line, eyespained. “I can’t
								say,” he said finally.
							</p>

							<p>
								Can’t say because you never actually made the choice? How can youlecture me, then? But
								that didn’t make sense. Her father was the best manshe knew.
							</p>

							<p>
								No, that wasn’t it. Her father had lived his life because he believed incertain ideas.
								That was what had led him to fight against Gavin Guile, togive up everything in that
								fight. He’d been a man of ideals. Those idealswere what had made him stay away from the
								Chromeria himself, what hadmade him oppose his daughter going to the Chromeria. He’d
								been afraidthat she would be corrupted by the Chromeria’s lack of ideals.
							</p>

							<p>
								A wise fear, as it turned out, Liv thought guiltily. She had beencorrupted. She had
								agreed to spy on Gavin. She was just as bad as everyoneelse at the Chromeria.
							</p>

							<p>
								But that didn’t explain why her father was suddenly fighting for the manhe should hate.
								The ideals hadn’t changed. If anything, Gavin being here,fighting Tyreans, should have
								made her father fight him all the morefiercely.
							</p>

							<p>
								Orholam, maybe her father had been corrupted too. Maybe he’d beenbought. Maybe he’d sold
								out his ideals just like everyone else. Her hearthurt at the very thought, but why else
								wouldn’t he tell her the answer towhat was an obvious question? Because it would make
								his hypocrisyundeniable.
							</p>

							<p>
								The whole swiving Chromeria was corrupt. It defiled everything ittouched. Liv had been
								at the bottom. She’d seen how monochromes weretreated; she’d seen how Tyreans were
								treated. And she’d become part of thepower, too. She’d become almost a friend to the
								Prism himself—and she’dloved it, loved talking with a powerful man, basking in his
								attention. She’dloved the beautiful dresses and being treated as special and worth
								attention.And to keep her power, she’d sold herself—so easily, so easily. But that
								washow things worked at the Chromeria. It had even corrupted her father.“Liv,” her
								father said. “Liv, trust me. I know it’s hard, but please.”“Trust you? When you won’t
								trust me?” she asked, pained.“Livy, please. I love you. You know I wouldn’t do anything
								to hurt you.”And then it all became clear and it took Liv’s breath away. How couldthe
								Prism get her father to betray everything he held dear? Why would herfather evade simple
								questions? Because he loved her. Corvan had beencorrupted, but not by money or power or
								sex. She knew he wouldn’t sell hissoul so cheaply. So what did the Prism have over
								Corvan? He had Liv.
							</p>

							<p>
								Gavin Guile was using Liv to suborn her father. She didn’t know whatexactly the threat
								and the bribe had been, but it didn’t matter. Liv was beingbribed and threatened exactly
								the same way, but by the Ruthgari. She knewhow the game was played, now. She had
								betrayed her principles becauseshe loved Vena. Her father was betraying his principles
								because he lovedLiv.
							</p>

							<p>
								Corvan had chosen that his fealty would be to his family only. Thatmeant Liv. And it
								meant he couldn’t tell her. Because if he told her, she’druin it and make his sacrifices
								worthless.
							</p>

							<p>
								Liv’s heart broke. She had to clamp down hard on her emotions to keepfrom bursting into
								tears. Cruel. So cruel. How could Gavin do such a thingand then smile at her?
							</p>

							<p>
								Because that’s how the Chromeria is. Vipers and villains, all of them.
							</p>

							<p>
								And Corvan had done everything he could to try to keep Liv out of
								theChromeria—everything short of ordering her not to go, because he wasn’tso imperious.
								It was her fault. Liv swallowed the sudden lump in her throat.Her father had been
								debased because of her. He deserved better than for herto expose his shame.
							</p>

							<p>
								She smiled as bravely as she could, pretending to acquiesce. “Iunderstand, father. I do
								trust you. Just tell me everything when you can. Fairenough?”“Fair enough,” Corvan said,
								his relief obvious. “I love you, Livy.”“I know you do, father.”And Gavin Guile was going
								to pay for turning that love against him.
							</p>

							<p>
								Chapter 64
							</p>

							<p>
								It’s simple, Kip. You’re not being asked to draft a pulley or a scull. Onelittle green
								ball. It’s nothing.
							</p>

							<p>
								He was sitting cross-legged, green spectacles on, white board in his lap,willing
								something to happen. He’d been doing this for two hours. And whatexactly was he doing?
								Nothing. How were you supposed to even keep yourmind on drafting when nothing happened
								for hours? His stomach wascomplaining again. It was constant now as the sun approached
								noon.
							</p>

							<p>
								No food until I draft? It’s cruel. It’s torture. It’s impossible.Kip looked up. Gavin
								had brought them only a few hundred pacesoutside the Lover’s Gate to the ruins of the
								old outer walls. When they’darrived, there were already hundreds of men at work, and
								since then, manyof those who’d been stuck in the line that they’d passed had joined
								them.They were excavating the roots of the wall down to bedrock, which was atleast four
								paces down in the few places Kip could see. The excavation,though, went faster than he
								would have thought possible, between the sheernumber of men working and the sandy soil,
								with only thin vegetation ontop.
							</p>

							<p>
								Gavin was poring over drawings with Master Danavis. General Danavis,
							</p>

							<p>
								Kip supposed, and the natural manner with which the general commandedmen to do this or
								that—exactly how he’d told Kip to go do this or that—made Kip wonder why he’d never
								wondered about Master Danavis before.The man was obviously too big for a little town
								like Rekton, but Kip hadnever even thought about him. Children only think about
								themselves, Kip.“It’s not good enough,” Gavin was saying. “No, the detail’s fine.
								Thedetail’s perfect. But the old wall didn’t stop us, so why rebuild somethingthat’s
								faulty?”
							</p>

							<p>
								Rebuild the wall? Hadn’t Gavin said that King Garadul’s army wasarriving in four or five
								days?“We’ll be lucky if we can get something that’s merely faulty,” General
							</p>

							<p>
								Danavis said. “We’ll be lucky if we can finish anything at all.”“Bring me the drawings
								of Rathcaeson,” the Prism said.“You’re seriously going to build a wall based on artists’
								renditions of amythical city?”
							</p>

							<p>
								The muscle in Gavin’s jaw twitched with irritation.“Understood, Lord Prism,” General
								Danavis said. He bobbed a bow.“Bring your daughter,” Gavin said. “I could use a
								superviolet.”A slight hesitation. “Of course.” The general left, mounting his horseand
								galloping toward the city, his Ruthgari personal guards trailing in hiswake.
							</p>

							<p>
								Then, though he’d been speaking nonstop with foremen, Ruthgariguards, and General
								Danavis all morning, Gavin was suddenly alone. Helooked over at Kip. Oops, I think I’m
								supposed to be drafting.
							</p>

							<p>
								Gavin cocked an eyebrow at him. “Not hungry yet, huh?”Kip grimaced. “Thanks for
								reminding me.”“Kip, more than any other color, green can be summarized in one word.
							</p>

							<p>
								All the others require at least a few, a bit of hedging, some qualifiers. Greenis wild.
								Everything both good and bad associated with wild is what green is.That’s why I can tell
								you that you only need will, because will and wildnessgo so naturally together. If you
								were an incipient blue, I’d have to explainthe sense of drafting, the harmony, the
								order, how it fits with the world.That’s not you. Any questions?”
							</p>

							<p>
								Not about drafting. “What happened to that gunner?”“What?” Gavin asked.“The one on the
								Ilytian boat, who nearly killed us. Right before I shothim, his gun blew up.”“It does
								happen,” Gavin said. “You overcharge your shot, the musketcan’t handle the charge.”“That
								gunner, who nearly hit us from five hundred paces? He misjudgeda musket?”
							</p>

							<p>
								Gavin smiled. He turned his palm over. There was nothing in it. Oh, Kiptightened his
								eyes. A superviolet ball rested in Gavin’s hand. “See it?”Gavin asked.“I see it.”Gavin
								extended his hand. A little pop, and his hand jumped back. Thesuperviolet ball streaked
								out like it was a musket ball itself. “I blocked hismusket barrel,” Gavin said,
								shrugging. “You can use any color to do it.Yellow only if you can make solid yellow, of
								course, but pretty muchanything else.”“Why not kill him?”“I may have,” Gavin said. “A
								musket exploding in your hands is nojoke.” He shrugged. “I recognized him. Freelancer
								during the war.Sometimes fought for me, sometimes for my brother, sometimes for
								anycaptain that would pay him enough. He’s a drunk and a scoundrel and thefinest artist
								of the cannon in the Seven Satrapies. Whatever name he wasborn with, now he’s simply
								known as Gunner. It’s everything he is. His firstunderdeck command as cannoneer was on a
								ship called the Aved Barayah,the Fire Breather.”“The Fire Breather? The Fire Breather?”
								Kip asked.“Only ship in memory to ever kill a full-grown sea demon. Gunner wasmaybe
								sixteen years old.” Gavin shook his head, dispelling a memory. “I’vekilled a lot of
								people, Kip. Sometimes you hesitate, and as bad and asdangerous as that is, I like to
								think it’s proof that I’ve still got somehumanity left. Besides, I knew making his gun
								blow up in his hands wouldreally infuriate him. If I know Gunner, he made that musket
								himself, andhe’s probably wondering who the hell overcharged his precious musket.”He
								glanced over to a richly dressed Ruthgari approaching, flanked byguards and slaves
								carrying a mobile pavilion to shade the light-skinnedman. “I’ll leave you to your work,”
								Gavin said. “You might want to hurry,the servants should be bringing lunch anytime.”
							</p>

							<p>
								Just when I’d sort of forgotten my stomach. Thanks.Kip pushed the spectacles up his
								nose—they kept slipping down, andthey weren’t even close to comfortable—and stared at
								the white board.Wild. Wild, unbridled, growing. The Ruthgari noble—Kip gathered it
								wasthe governor—was complaining shrilly to Gavin about something or other,and he stood
								as if he was going to take his time about it. Kip tried to blockhim out.
							</p>

							<p>
								Green. Come on, let’s suck up some wildness.Wild, now there’s a word for me. Kip the
								wild. I was pretty wild when
							</p>

							<p>
								Ram used to call me Tubby, huh? I was pretty wild when he made me backdown over Isa.
								She’d be alive if I’d been a little wilder. To be wild is theopposite of being
								controlled, and I’ve been controlled for my whole life.Controlled by Ram, by Ram! A
								village tough. A boy! Barely a bully.
							</p>

							<p>
								If Kip had told Ram to go to the evernight, if he had shredded Ram withhis tongue, what
								could Ram have done except beat him? Ram’s musclesweren’t half a match for Kip’s brain.
							</p>

							<p>
								Well, they’re not a match for anything now that they’re rotting.The thought made Kip
								queasy. He didn’t want Ram dead. There’d beenplenty of good things about the boy. A few,
								anyway. And if Kip didn’t feelterrible that Ram was dead, he did wish the boy were alive
								so he could facehim now.
							</p>

							<p>
								I’ve talked with Gavin Guile. I sank pirates with him! Well, mostly Itried not to drown
								while he sank pirates, but still.
							</p>

							<p>
								Kip looked at his hands. Still no luxin. The governor was stillcomplaining loudly.
								Orholam, how was Gavin standing it? The man had themost nasal voice Kip had ever heard.
								Kip wanted to bean the man in thehead with a big old ball of green luxin. He glanced at
								his hands again.Nothing.
							</p>

							<p>
								I’m going to fail Gavin. Again. Like I failed Isa. Like I failed Sanson.
							</p>

							<p>
								Like I failed my mother a thousand times.
							</p>

							<p>
								Hunger gnawed Kip’s belly. That’s all I am, a fat failure. A new life’sbeen handed to me
								on a plate. Gavin Guile’s son, bastard son, sure, but hehasn’t once treated me like an
								embarrassment. And I can’t even summonthe will to reach out and take this new life. In
								return for all the good he’sdone me, I’m going to humiliate the man who saved my life,
								who gave me asecond chance.
							</p>

							<p>
								It was like bands of iron were being laid across his chest, and now theytightened,
								tightened. Kip could barely breathe. His eyes welled with tears.Baby. Failure.
								Disappointment. His mother’s face, twisted, dangerouslyhigh from smoking ratweed laced
								with ergot: You ruined my life! You’rethe worst mistake I ever made. I gave everything
								and you took it all andgave me nothing! You make me sick, Kip.
							</p>

							<p>
								Kip, you can throw off those chains. Stop believing those—“Lies!” the governor shouted.
								Kip shivered, his skin tingling. The sunwas nearly at its zenith. Orholam’s eye pressed
								down on the land like aphysical weight, but to Kip it was a caress. Light, energy,
								warmth, love,light in dark corners. He looked at the white board, and in the green
								filteredthrough his spectacles, he saw one face of Orholam. Kip wouldn’t call
								itwildness. It was freedom. He wanted to shout, dance for joy, to hell withwhat anyone
								thought. There was freedom from all of that, and freedomfrom the prison of his own head,
								freedom from the nagging voices of doubt,from the running commentary about everything he
								saw and did. It wasaction, and it was as powerful as a redwood springing up in the
								cracks of aboulder. Life would win. The roots would reach and heave and strain.
							</p>

							<p>
								Kip could feel those bands of iron around his chest burst asunder. He feltmore alive
								than he had in his whole life. An animal strength and joy.
							</p>

							<p>
								So this is what they mean by wild.The yapping governor’s voice shrilled. Kip drew a ball
								of green luxininto his hand. Just like that? Just by deciding to do it? It seemed too
								easy.The ball was thick, dense, but flexible to his squeezing fingers. Kip made
								itbigger, hollow, about twice the size of his own head. Now the flexibilitywas
								exaggerated. Soft enough that it wasn’t going to kill anyone.
							</p>

							<p>
								With the biggest grin on his face, Kip held it in his palms. How had
							</p>

							<p>
								Gavin shot out luxin? Kip had seen Ironfist do it too. He wrinkled his nose.Maybe I just
								will it.
							</p>

							<p>
								A tiny part of his mind was protesting: You can’t assault the governor!
							</p>

							<p>
								He’s the governor, for Orholam’s sake. You think his bodyguards are goingto appreciate
								that you don’t really mean to hurt him?
							</p>

							<p>
								But in the grip of green, words like “governor” were bled of meaning.
							</p>

							<p>
								What was that? What was the difference? The trappings of human ritualsand human titles
								seemed artificial, thin.
							</p>

							<p>
								Kip willed the ball to shoot out of his hands. Still seated, grinning like afool, he
								could feel energy coiling up behind the ball. How long did he letthat build before he
								let it go? Oh well, that felt like long enough. A muffledcrack and the ball jetted out
								of Kip’s hands, fast.
							</p>

							<p>
								Still seated on the ground, he was blasted ass over elbows.Rolling to his knees,
								laughing, Kip looked to see what had happened tothe yapping man.
							</p>

							<p>
								The governor was laid out, and apparently the green luxin ball hadbounced around some,
								because the palanquin was collapsing, two of theslaves tumbling away from it. The
								palanquin dropped right on top of thegovernor, and Kip heard him shrieking—but his view
								was blocked as one ofthe bodyguards charged Kip, sword out.
							</p>

							<p>
								Spectacles askew, Kip couldn’t draw any more green, but he still had agood amount in his
								body. He began drawing another, smaller ball. Too slow,too slow!
							</p>

							<p>
								The air shimmered between him and the swordsman as he raised hishands. There was a crack
								from his hands and a tiny green ball shot out,snapping both hands back painfully from
								the kick.
							</p>

							<p>
								A wall of blue luxin unfurled between Kip and the swordsman in theblink of an eye. The
								swordsman’s sword struck the blue wall in midlungetoward the kneeling boy. The blade
								screeched as it was forced downward,peeling off layers of blue. The swordsman himself
								smacked bodily into theblue a split second later, grunting. There was a sound like glass
								cracking,and a high-pitched whine.
							</p>

							<p>
								The swordsman recovered, then stopped. The blue luxin right in front ofhis face was
								cracked from Kip’s shot, spiderwebs centered where his headwould have been, a
								musket-ball-sized crater in the blue luxin.“Enough,” Gavin said. He didn’t raise his
								voice, just injected it in amoment of silence. His blue wall had saved both of them.
							</p>

							<p>
								Kip felt shaken, weak. Oh, shit. What did I just do?The governor, still protesting, was
								pulled from the fallen palanquin bytwo of his bodyguards. He stood, nose bleeding, face
								flushed fromembarrassment rapidly giving way to rage, and stormed over to Gavin.“Your
								slave has assaulted me, I demand satisfaction!” The governordrew the decorative blade
								hanging at his hip and pointed it at Kip.
							</p>

							<p>
								A muscle jumped in Gavin’s jaw. “That’s no slave. Kip is my naturalson.”“This, this is
								your bastard?”Stony silence from Gavin. Finally, “Kip, apologize.”Kip swallowed and
								stood, unable to conceal his trembling. “I’m terriblysorry, sir. I was practicing
								drafting for the first time. I really didn’t knowwhat I was—”“An apology? No, Lord
								Prism, first you assault me, and now thisoutrage? I demand satisfaction.”“You’ll demand
								nothing,” Gavin said. He never broke eye contact.“You’re corrupt if not treasonous,
								Governor Crassos. You’ve been colludingwith King Garadul, and if I can find just a
								little more evidence of it, I swearwhen you return to Ruthgar, your head will have a
								pike waiting for it.Unless Satrapah Ptolos decides to hand you over to the Parians
								instead.
							</p>

							<p>
								You’re incompetent, contemptible, a liar, a thief, and a coward. If you
								wantsatisfaction, you can duel with me. Sword to sword. On my word of honor Iwon’t
								draft, but we’ll do it right now.”
							</p>

							<p>
								The governor blinked and the sword point trembled. He blinked again.
							</p>

							<p>
								Sheathed his blade. “I’ll leave brawling with swords to the benighted.” Hesnarled and
								turned on his heel, storming off.
							</p>

							<p>
								Kip became aware that someone was right behind him. He turned andsaw Ironfist looming
								over him. “How long have you been there?” he asked.“Long enough to protect you from your
								foolishness, if not long enoughto stop it. I wasn’t aware you had your family’s knack
								for getting intotrouble in the blink of an eye.”
							</p>

							<p>
								Oh, the blue wall had been Ironfist’s. Was that twice over now that Kipowed his life to
								the huge Blackguard?“Commander,” Gavin said, “I need you to go speak with our spies.
							</p>

							<p>
								Crassos is rattled. He may run. Make sure the crews manning the cannons atthe harbor’s
								entrance are men who will obey the order to fire, if it comes tothat. And that he
								doesn’t plunder the treasury. I need to be able to pay ourarmy.”
							</p>

							<p>
								Ironfist frowned. “I’d prefer not to leave Kip. I’m a Blackguard, Lord
							</p>

							<p>
								Prism, not a messenger. My duty is here.”
							</p>

							<p>
								Gavin said, “I can’t do it. Kip can’t do it. It needs doing. This is my faultfor
								forbidding you to bring more Blackguards, but the point remains.”
							</p>

							<p>
								Commander Ironfist hesitated only one second more. “Very well, Lord
							</p>

							<p>
								Prism.” He bowed and headed for the horses someone had brought forthem.
							</p>

							<p>
								When he had gone, there was a conspicuous silence. Dozens ofworkmen had seen what had
								happened, and humiliating the governor hadclearly earned Gavin some goodwill, but no one
								appeared to want to comeclose either, lest Gavin was angry. Gavin rubbed his forehead.
								“You’reprobably wondering why we’re going to fight a war for assholes like
								thatgovernor,” he said.
							</p>

							<p>
								Actually, the thought hadn’t occurred to Kip, but now that Gavinbrought it up, it did
								seem odd.“Because Rask Garadul had the stench of a fanatic, Kip. That’s all.
							</p>

							<p>
								Hundreds, or if we’re unlucky, thousands of people will die because I metRask for a few
								minutes and I thought he was crazy.” Gavin expelled abreath. “He wants this city, and
								honestly, he’s got a right to it. If I couldsimply give this city back to Tyrea’s
								people, I would. They deserve it. They—you—have paid too high of a price for a war in
								which they took the onlyside they could. If there were anyone else who would take over
								after weleft, I’d do it, and damn the Spectrum. But with Rask in power… It’s a
								littlemore complicated than that, of course, but that’s why I’m here, and mypresence is
								what will make this a near thing. If we left, Rask would marchin unopposed, close the
								harbor before the Parians could land, and thatwould be pretty much the end of it. The
								Parians would be furious, but theprofits here aren’t so great that they want to march an
								army here.Eventually, Rask would offer an exclusive shipping contract on all the
								citrusfrom Garriston for a few years, and they’d take it. What do you think? Is itworth
								it?”
							</p>

							<p>
								He’s asking me like my opinion is worth something. Kip hadn’t had thatmany adults care
								what he thought. “I think King Garadul should die andsave us all this trouble.”
							</p>

							<p>
								Gavin laughed ruefully. “If only. Maybe Karris will work a miracle anddo just that.”“You
								really miss her, don’t you?” Kip asked before he could stophimself.
							</p>

							<p>
								Gavin looked at Kip sharply. Then he looked away. Relented. After aminute, he expelled a
								long breath, and it was like Kip was watching Gavin’shope leak out of him. “That
								obvious, huh?” Gavin asked.“You think they’ll kill her?” Kip asked.A number of emotions
								flitted over Gavin’s face, settling in resignation,sorrow too deep for tears. “She’ll
								live until Rask sees if I’ll trade the cityfor her. Then he’ll kill her. Either way.”
							</p>

							<p>
								No. No they won’t, Kip thought. I swear it.
							</p>

							<p>
								Chapter 65
							</p>

							<p>
								The empty feeling in Kip’s stomach didn’t go away when they servedlunch. Gavin and
								General Danavis—even though it was weird to think ofhim as General Danavis rather than
								Master Danavis, it was too weird forKip to think of him as just Corvan—and even Liv were
								poring over thedrawings and plans with architects and artists while they ate. Kip sat to
								oneside, out of the way. He had no idea what they were doing, and spacearound the table
								was limited. He ate fresh oranges with gusto, and tore intothe intriguing spiced fresh
								javelina. It tasted amazing, but even he couldn’tkeep his mind on food for long.“I’d ask
								if you’re serious,” General Danavis was saying, “but you havethat look.”“The problem
								isn’t the drafting,” Gavin said. “I can handle that muchluxin easily—”“Easily?” General
								Danavis interrupted, dubiously.“Fine, not easily, but I can do it. The problem is the
								weight. I can’t liftthis much, much less throw it into place.”
							</p>

							<p>
								Liv cleared her throat gently, as if unsure she really wanted to intrude.“Aliviana?”
								Gavin asked.She colored. “Please, Liv.” She brushed her hair back nervously. “Howabout
								this?” She drafted something onto the table. It was, of course,superviolet, and thus
								invisible to most people.
							</p>

							<p>
								General Danavis scowled. Apparently, most people included him.“Sorry, father,” she said.
								“I can’t control yellow enough to make modelswith it.”
							</p>

							<p>
								Kip tried to see what she’d drafted, but the table was obscured bybodies.
							</p>

							<p>
								Gavin chuckled. “It looks ridiculous,” he said, and Liv blanched. “Butit’ll work.
								Perfect. Fine. What do our architects think of the design?”
							</p>

							<p>
								For a moment, Kip thought Gavin was being pretty rude. Obviously,
							</p>

							<p>
								General Danavis and everyone else around the table was curious about whatLiv had
								designed. But this was Gavin as leader. All the rest of them didn’tneed to know, and
								there was work to be done. He understood the solution tothe problem, and that was all
								that was necessary. On to the next problem.
							</p>

							<p>
								Which is what I should be doing. Kip had finished lunch. He could nowdraft a little bit,
								and on purpose. He knew what he had to do.“My Lord Prism, none of us has ever built a
								wall of this magnitude, or,or—or a wall at all, to tell the truth,” a nervous architect
								said, “but these olddrawings you’ve shown us of Rathcaeson are clearly flawed. Too
								muchfantasy, not enough function.”“This empty desert doesn’t have enough function,”
								Gavin said sharply.“Tell me what we need to do to fix it. I need to start building now,
								today.”
							</p>

							<p>
								The architect blinked. Swallowed. “Uh, here.” He drew a line with hisfinger. “This
								interior passage isn’t wide enough. You’re going to have menrushing back and forth in
								armor, with guns, cannons being rolled intoposition, or replaced for repair. This
								passage must be wide enough for mento run past each other and past carts or
								cannons.”“How wide?” Gavin demanded.“I’d say, uh…” He held his fingers apart on the
								drawing.“For Orholam’s sake, write on it,” Gavin said.“Sir, those drawings are hundreds
								of years old, priceless relics of—”another man, perhaps an artist, protested.“Priceless
								is being alive next week,” Gavin snapped. “Continue.”Kip didn’t know why he’d been so
								slow, but it only dawned on him nowthat Gavin was seriously planning on building a wall,
								here. Before KingGaradul’s army arrived. In four days.
							</p>

							<p>
								Oh, maybe because it’s impossible?Of course, crossing the Cerulean Sea in a morning was
								impossible too.But seriously, did Gavin mean to draft the entire thing by himself?
								Kipdidn’t know all that much about drafting and how much a drafter couldsafely use in a
								day, but the mere fact that the world wasn’t bursting withluxin buildings and bridges
								and walls told him that it had to be incrediblydifficult. In fact, the only luxin
								buildings he’d seen had been at theChromeria, and he had to guess that the seven towers
								had been the productof a huge collaborative effort.
							</p>

							<p>
								The architect, a squinting little man, after puffing out his cheeks anumber of times,
								deep in thought, began drawing quickly. “The cutouts onthese murder holes don’t give
								sufficient range of fire. If you modify the topof the wall like this, scaling ladders
								won’t be able to hook onto the wall—atleast not as easily. A railing on the back, like
								so, will save more of yourown men from falling off the wall than theirs. These areas on
								top of the wallneed to be bigger so you can store more powder for the cannons. There’s
								noplace in these drawings for taking the wounded. I think you couldincorporate that
								here. If you can set sleds like this right into the wall of theinterior passage, it’ll
								be easier to move materiel around. There are also nolantern hooks in this plan. Your
								wall will be entirely dark if you don’t fixthis. You’ll need cranes here, here, and here
								to lift supplies.”“You’ve never built a wall before, huh?” Gavin asked.“I have studied a
								few,” the architect said.“How much am I paying you?”“Uh, nothing yet, Lord Prism.”“Well,
								double it!” Gavin ordered.The architect looked befuddled, obviously doing the arithmetic
								and notliking the result, but not wanting to call the Prism himself out on it.“He’s
								joking,” General Danavis told the man.Gavin’s eyes sparkled.“Oh.” The man looked
								relieved. Then Kip could see the question crosshis face: joking about giving me nothing,
								or joking about giving me morefor doing a good job?
							</p>

							<p>
								Gavin said, “Keep working. This man here will take notes. I’m going togo lay the
								foundation.”“He means that metaphorically, right?” the architect asked, squinting atthe
								receding figure of the Prism.“Our Prism’s a bear for metaphors,” General Danavis
								said.“Huh?” the architect asked.Kip stood, feeling heartsick. Now was going to be as
								good of a chanceto escape as he was going to get.“Kip!” Gavin’s voice rang out, drawing
								everyone’s eye to Kip. Kip felt asurge of panic and embarrassment at having been caught
								so easily. “Welldone today. It’s not many boys who can draft consciously on their first
								dayof trying.”
							</p>

							<p>
								A flush of pleasure went through Kip, only doubled by the impressedlook that flitted
								over Liv’s face.“Liv!” Gavin called out, making her head whip around. “I want you tomake
								models: lay out the curvature of the halls, widths for the top of thewall, whatever the
								architect tells you.”“Yes, Lord Prism!” she said, her eyes turning back to the table and
								herwork.
							</p>

							<p>
								Now or never. If he waited, Ironfist would be back, shadowing himwherever he went. Kip
								looked at General Danavis, head down, makingsuggestions; Liv, listening intently; and
								finally at Gavin. These were theonly people in the world who meant anything to him, and
								incredibly, theyaccepted him. Tolerated him, anyway. With them, for the first time in
								hislife, he felt like he was part of something.
							</p>

							<p>
								Kip turned his back and walked toward the city.
							</p>

							<p>
								Chapter 66
							</p>

							<p>
								It was only as Kip approached the Lover’s Gate that he understood whyGavin was
								attempting to build a new wall. The old wall was encrusted withhomes, shops, and inns
								like a ship with barnacles, except here the wallswere covered both inside and out. In
								places, people’s roofs were almostlevel with the top of the wall. If Gavin wanted to
								make that wall defensible,he’d have to level hundreds of homes. The demolition itself
								would havetaken four days.
							</p>

							<p>
								Clearly, the effect on the people’s opinion of demolishing the homes ofperhaps a fifth
								of the city’s population would be ruinous. Gavin had only afew days in which to make the
								people who remained in the city want tofight for him rather than for his enemy. He’d
								been caught betweenimpossible choices: leave the people’s homes propped against the
								innerwalls and have a militarily indefensible wall, or tear the houses down andrisk
								turning an already divided populace against him. So Gavin had decidedto build his own
								wall.
							</p>

							<p>
								Unbelievable. How must it have been during the Prisms’ War, whenpeople had to choose
								which brother to fight beside? It would have been likefighting beside giants, knowing
								that their slightest move might crush you,but knowing that standing in the no-man’s-land
								between them would beeven worse.
							</p>

							<p>
								Kip found his way back to his rooms and packed what he guessed he’dneed. Cloak and food,
								and more food, and short sword, and a stick of tindanars in a money belt. It was more
								than he thought he’d need—he hopedthey’d forgive him for that, but he might need money
								for bribes. Then hedecided he’d need to leave a note so they didn’t waste precious
								timesearching for him.
							</p>

							<p>
								There was a quill and parchment on the desk in his room, so hescratched out the letters
								laboriously. “I’m Tyrean and young. More help as aspy than here. No one will suspect me.
								Will try to find Karris.” He signedthe note, folded it after the ink dried, and stuck it
								under the covers in Liv’sbed.
							</p>

							<p>
								Then he scratched out another one. “Went to buy some food and watchminstrel shows.
								Shaken after drafting. Will be back by midnight.”
							</p>

							<p>
								That one he left on the desk. They would find it first and give him ahead start. They
								wouldn’t find out he was truly gone until after nightfall. Atthat point, they’d know he
								would be too far gone for them to catch him.
							</p>

							<p>
								With what he felt must have been suspiciously overloaded saddlebags,
							</p>

							<p>
								Kip made his way past the gate guards and to the stable.“I need a horse,” Kip told the
								stableman imperiously.The man returned his gaze, not moving from his position leaning
								againstone wall. “Right place,” he said.
							</p>

							<p>
								Kip had a sinking feeling. The man wasn’t buying that he was anyonewho could give
								orders. If Kip couldn’t get a horse, he couldn’t do anything.It would be the shortest
								attempt at running away in history. He hadn’t evengotten out of the house. “Uh, I need
								something not too ostentatious, and nottoo… spirited.”“Not much of a rider, huh?” The
								man’s tone said, Must not be much of aman.
							</p>

							<p>
								Confess your ineptitude and fall on his mercy, Kip. “What’s your name,shit shoveler?” he
								demanded instead. Oops.
							</p>

							<p>
								The groom blinked and stood up straight unconsciously. “Gallos… sir,”he added
								uncertainly.“I don’t ride these stinking meat barrels much, but I need one
								that’sreliable, that can handle my fat ass, and that won’t panic when I use magic,you
								understand? And I don’t have time for your superciliosity.” Was thateven a word? Kip
								bulled forward. The groom probably didn’t know either.“There’s a war on. Get me my
								damned horse and save the shit-packing foryour stable boys.”
							</p>

							<p>
								The groom moved with alacrity, saddling an old draft horse. “Best I gotfor what you’ve
								asked, sir,” the man said.
							</p>

							<p>
								A draft horse? I’m not that fat.“Sorry, sir, only one I got.”“It’ll do,” Kip said.
								“Thank you.” No need to press his luck. The stirrupdid look impossibly high, however.
								Instead of humiliating himself by tryingto mount and most likely failing, he took the
								reins and led the beast out intothe city, taking care to tip the groom.
							</p>

							<p>
								Orholam, I really was an asshole. Kip didn’t know what made it moredisconcerting: that
								being an asshole had promptly gotten him his way, orthat he had enjoyed exerting mastery
								over another man. Back home, hewould have been whipped, and he would have deserved it.
							</p>

							<p>
								In the streets, he kept his eyes peeled until he found a man roughly hisown size,
								wearing a coat despite the heat. It looked old, worn, and costmaybe as much as one of
								Kip’s coat’s pockets. Kip traded with the man.Then he bought wine and water in one of
								the streets leading to the watermarket and was convincing a shopkeeper that he really
								did want to trade hisfine cloak for a plain woolen one when he heard loud voices. He
								turned.
							</p>

							<p>
								Some old man was standing in the back of a wagon, exhorting the crowdheading into the
								water market, most of whom were ignoring him. “—tohave our own nation again. With our
								own king! You all want to writheunder the bootheel of the Parians again? Do you remember
								what they didlast time? Have you no memory?!”“They killed hundreds for listening to
								nonsense like yours!” someoneshouted.“And I say we don’t have to let them ever do it
								again,” the old mansnapped back. That got some murmurs of agreement.“Everyone who wanted
								to listen to your shilling for King Garadul hasalready left!” a shopkeeper yelled.“The
								king isn’t willing that any should perish. Come, join him, andfight!”“We don’t want to
								fight. We don’t want to kill. We don’t want to bekilled. We want to live.”“Cowards!” the
								old man said. Then he shuffled off to look for a moresympathetic audience.
							</p>

							<p>
								Kip was about to head out of town when something caught his eye.
							</p>

							<p>
								There was a new ship in the bay, a galleon flying a white flag with seventowers. The
								Chromeria’s flag. Almost at the moment that he identified theflag, he saw a line of men
								and women walking through the streets led by atleast a dozen Blackguards. He froze.
								Guilty conscience. They didn’t knowhim, and he didn’t see the only two Blackguards he’d
								seen before, Stumpand whatever the other one’s name had been.
							</p>

							<p>
								The people behind the Blackguards were perhaps more interesting,though, and Kip studied
								them as they passed half a block away and turneddown a street to head toward the
								Travertine Palace. There were perhaps twohundred of them, and Kip was sure that every
								last one was a drafter. A fewhad eyes light enough that he could see their irises were
								solid blue or greenor red, but some of the lighter-skinned among them actually had a
								visibletint to their skin. Some concealed that with long sleeves. Other didn’t seemto
								care. “… be true, but it looks better than the last time we were here,Samila,” a
								blue-tinged man said. Despite his light-enough-to-show-colorskin, the man had his hair
								in dreadlocks almost to his waist. The womanwas stunning, perhaps forty years old, with
								solid blue irises, highcheekbones, and the olive skin of the western Atashian upper
								classes. Bothwore rich clothing.
							</p>

							<p>
								Samila Sayeh and Izem Blue? No, surely not. Those names were justfrom stories. Surely
								there were plenty of drafters their age who happened tobe blues and reds who had special
								relationships with each other.
							</p>

							<p>
								Next came more Blackguards, helping infirm drafters or wheeling themin chairs. Kip
								decided not to wait to see if Stump were with them.
							</p>

							<p>
								He turned to slip through the crowd—and found himself face-to-facewith Liv. She stood
								with her hands on her hips, her jaw tight. She flickedher eyes to the horse and back to
								Kip. Gulp.“I can explain,” Kip said.“You already did. Twice.” There was no amusement in
								her tone.She’d found both notes. Oh hell.“Don’t stop me, Liv, please.”“What do you think
								you’re doing?” She lowered her voice. “You thinkyou’re going to spy? You’re going to
								find Karris? And do what?”
							</p>

							<p>
								His jaw set. “I’m going to save her.”She made no effort to hide her incredulity. “That
								is one of the moreridiculous things I’ve heard in my life, Kip. If you want to run
								awaybecause it’s too dangerous here, you don’t need to pretend—”“Go to hell!” he said,
								stunning even himself. Her eyes shot wide. Hecouldn’t believe he’d said that to Liv—Liv,
								for Orholam’s sake! “I’msorry!” He said it too loud and some people around them looked
								at him. Helowered his voice sheepishly. “I’m really sorry, that was stupid to say,
								andmean. I didn’t mean it. I—Liv.” He paused, then bulled ahead. “I’mnothing. I’ve been
								a nothing for my whole life. And I’m being catapultedinto having people treat me
								different because of something I had no controlover? Because of my father?” He could see
								on her face that she understood.She knew exactly what he meant. “Liv, I owe Gavin
								everything, and hehasn’t asked anything of me.”“He will,” Liv said darkly.“Has he ever
								asked you to do anything wrong, Liv?”“Not yet,” she admitted. “I’m just saying that you
								have to look out foryourself when it comes to people from the Chromeria.”“And what?
								You’re not one of them? If you make me go back, you’ll bemaking me break my
								word.”“What?” Liv looked like he’d just slapped her face.“I swore that I was going to
								save Karris. Don’t you see, Liv? I’m perfectprecisely because I’m a nothing. Look at my
								eyes!” Still confused, shelooked at his eyes. “No color, no halo,” Kip said. “But I can
								draft. Liv, forthe first time in my life, I know exactly what I have to do. No one is
								makingme do this. I’m doing it because it’s right. There’s something tremendously—” He
								clenched his hands, trying to pull in the words. “Freeing. Powerful.I don’t know what,
								but I know it feels good.”“Even if you go to your death?” Liv asked.He chuckled
								joylessly. “I’m not being a hero, Liv. I just don’t likemyself that much. So what if I
								die?”“That’s the most awful thing I’ve ever heard,” Liv said.“I’m sorry,” Kip said. “I’m
								not trying to be pitiful. I’m just saying—I’vegot nothing. I’m an orphan, at best a
								bastard. A shame. I just don’t have thatmuch to lose. If I can do something good with my
								life—or even with mydeath—then how could I not try?”
							</p>

							<p>
								He could see her wavering. For the first time, he had hope that he couldactually get
								away with this.“Please, Liv. If I fail in this—if I can’t even get out of the city—I
								reallyam a nothing. Please. Don’t make me fail in the most important thing I’veever
								tried to do.”
							</p>

							<p>
								She blinked, then grinned. “I never thought what might happen if youturned that wily
								tongue against me. You ought to be an orange.”“I do resemble one in general shape, but
								I’m not sure—”“A drafter, not a fruit!” she said, laughing.
							</p>

							<p>
								Oh, he was like a slippery drafter.“Does this mean you’re not going to stop me?” Kip
								said.“Worse,” she said.“Huh?”“You have to do what’s right; I have to do what’s right.
								You’re myresponsibility, Kip.”“Oh no you don’t.”“Yes. I’m going with you—or you’re not
								going.”“Liv, you don’t understand—” She doesn’t understand what? Thatyou’re totally
								smitten with her? That she’s beautiful and smart andwonderful and amazing and your whole
								soul longs just to be with her, butyou can’t imagine putting her in danger?“I don’t
								understand what?” she asked. Damn it.“You’re light to me.” It slipped out. He couldn’t
								believe he’d said it outloud. His eyes went wide even before hers did.
							</p>

							<p>
								He’d been nearly physically naked before her when that assassin hadtried to kill him.
								This was worse. He was paralyzed. His lips failed him.“Very funny, Kip, but you’re not
								going to fool me and slip away when
							</p>

							<p>
								I’m not looking or something. You might be wily, but I wasn’t bornyesterday.”
							</p>

							<p>
								Oh, thank Orholam! She thought he was joking! A wave of relief passedover him, leaving
								his knees weak.“I’m going with you,” Liv said, “and that’s final. You’re right:
								whatyou’re trying is a good thing. I know Karris is worth saving, and what she’slearned
								could change the whole war. And if you want to succeed, you’regoing to need my help, and
								you’d be making me break my oath to look afteryou if you don’t let me come.”
							</p>

							<p>
								He had used that “don’t make me break my oath” thing as the wholelinchpin of his
								argument. He didn’t particularly like having it turned againsthim, but with his whole
								brain in a fog—his heart was still pounding hard—he couldn’t exactly counter
								it.“Besides,” Liv said more quietly, “even if you’re not running away fromanything,
								maybe one of us is.”“Huh?” Kip said. “Huh” is the best I can manage? Great.“I’m coming.
								Let’s go,” Liv said.Together, they found the old man who’d been shouting at the
								crowdearlier, and got directions to King Garadul’s army: “Head south and followthe
								tracks. Thousands have gone already. If you want to join the army ratherthan be useless
								like the rest of the camp followers, tell the recruitingsergeant that Gerain sent you.”
							</p>

							<p>
								The guards at the Hag’s Gate didn’t even look at them twice. Outside thecity, Kip found
								a rock, stood on it, and wiggled his way into the saddle. Livtook his hand and climbed
								up behind him. The huge draft horse seemed tohave no trouble with the weight. Kip willed
								himself to relax as Liv put herarms around his waist to hold on.
							</p>

							<p>
								Still, Kip hesitated, looking north, looking back at Garriston. Come on,
							</p>

							<p>
								Kip, you’ve done dumber things and lived to tell the tale.
							</p>

							<p>
								Not so sure about that. Still, Kip prodded the big horse and they beganthe long trip.

								Chapter 67
							</p>

							<p>
								It started as a dull throb. It always did. For a while, Karris hoped herstomach was
								reacting to the food King Garadul was practically forcingdown her gullet. Karris hadn’t
								had her moon blood in six months. Like mostof the women of the Blackguard, her flow was
								irregular at best. Their levelof training simply precluded it. But when Karris had hers,
								it was like herbody was making up for lost pain.
							</p>

							<p>
								Damn King Garadul. This was his fault. The enforced boredom wasdriving Karris
								mad—sitting in the wagon, unable to do much, andconstantly checked on. When they’d found
								her doing strength exercises,they’d sent in three drafters and two Mirrormen. The six
								barely all fit in thelittle wagon. Karris had been seized by the Mirrormen and laid over
								theknee of one of the drafters. Literally laid over her knee.
							</p>

							<p>
								The woman had produced a man’s leather belt and beat Karris’s bottomraw. Like she was a
								recalcitrant child. She’d been caught three times, andthe punishment never changed, but
								gradually her will to resist did. It hadseemed like too small and inconsequential a
								rebellion to keep up.
							</p>

							<p>
								Now she wished she had. The throbbing was already spreading to herback. Not long now for
								the diarrhea to start.
							</p>

							<p>
								Love being a woman.The other women of the Blackguard took advantage of their
								relativefreedom from moon blood as also granting relative freedom from worryingabout
								pregnancy. Karris just enjoyed her relative freedom from pain. It hadbeen years since
								she’d had sex with anything more than her pillow. Not thatshe wanted to think about that
								right now. In fact, she thought if she evensaw a man she’d tear his eyes out.
							</p>

							<p>
								It was for men that women suffered this. As the old saw said, a womanhas to bleed to
								fertilize man’s seed. Chronologically confused, but trueenough.
							</p>

							<p>
								They brought her the dress in the morning.It wasn’t the kind of clothing one would
								expect to be asked to wear forone’s execution. It wasn’t an exact copy of the dress
								she’d worn when she’dfinally given in to her father’s demands and joined Gavin at the
								head of hisarmies when they’d reclaimed Ru, but it was close. For one thing, it wasblack
								silk rather than green. King Garadul’s tailor had obviously beenworking either from
								memory or a painting of the day or they had simplydecided to alter the dress for the
								changes of sixteen years of fashion.
							</p>

							<p>
								The fit would be perfect, of course.Karris stared at the dress with loathing all day, as
								cramps wracked herguts, as the inevitable diarrhea came, as she nearly passed out a
								couple oftimes. That dress symbolized more than giving in to Rask Garadul’schildish
								fantasy. That dress was Karris’s youth. It was the girl she’d been. Itwas femininity,
								softness, yielding. The desperate grubbing for people’seyes, for the jealousy of the
								other girls, for the envy of older women, for theattention of men. Karris had been weak
								and petty and stupid, hopelesslydependent.
							</p>

							<p>
								They would force her to wear the dress, of course. She could wear itnow, or be beaten
								until she gave in and wore it. Of course, she could tear itto shreds. While satisfying,
								that would only delay the inevitable. Besides,they weren’t going to let her out of here
								without the dress. She was certainof that much. What she didn’t know was if they would
								let her out even withthe dress. Still, it was a better chance than nothing. And how was
								she goingto kill Rask Garadul from in here?
							</p>

							<p>
								She put on the dress.She wanted to hate it. She wanted to hate it with a passion. But
								shehadn’t worn anything that fit her so well in years. Her Blackguard garb, ofcourse,
								fit like a glove, but those were work clothes. This, the whisper offine silk on skin,
								was altogether different. It fit like a sheath. If it hadn’tbeen so perfectly tailored,
								she wouldn’t have been able to breathe, muchless move. The dress was curve-hugging
								around her hips and stomach, andthe more generous scalloped neckline drew attention to
								both the liquiddazzle of folds of fine silk and to her cleavage. Surely her old dress
								hadn’tbeen so low-cut in the back, the few thin interlaced ties only emphasizingher
								back’s essential nakedness. Looking down at her chest—there was nomirror in the room—she
								hoped she didn’t get cold. If she did, everyone wasgoing to know it.
							</p>

							<p>
								Had her dress been unlined when she was that stupid sixteen-year-old?
							</p>

							<p>
								Had she not even noticed? She honestly couldn’t remember. All she couldremember was
								loving that dress. She’d felt like the goddess Atirat standingnext to Gavin in it, long
								hair caught up in a diamond-and-emerald-encrustedtiara, people practically worshipping
								them. She’d convinced herself that shecould love Gavin. At first, before the Luxlords’
								Ball, she’d felt moreattraction toward him than toward Dazen. Surely she could blow that
								coalback to flame.
							</p>

							<p>
								Dazen had been perpetually in his elder brother’s shadow, and heseemed content with it.
								Gavin had been so confident, so masterful. She’dbeen drawn to him irresistibly, as
								everyone was. But after that night at theLuxlords’ Ball, everything had changed. After
								she got to know Dazen,suddenly there hadn’t seemed to be much depth to Gavin. Dazen had
								neverunderstood his own strength. He had worshipped Gavin, projected all hisown virtues
								onto his older brother, been blind to his faults and exaggeratedhis qualities. Gavin had
								fed on all the adoration and grown fat on it.
							</p>

							<p>
								But Gavin was still gorgeous, stylish, commanding, and admired. To thesixteen-year-old
								Karris, other people’s regard had been very important.She’d always wanted to please her
								father, her mother, Koios and her otherbrothers, her magisters, everyone. Gavin was
								everything good. He was thePrism, his brother by that point a disgraced runaway and a
								murderer. Karrisremembered convincing herself she could be content with the
								Prism.Content—with the most admired, feared, desired man in the SevenSatrapies. Besides,
								after what Dazen had done, she had to marry Gavin orwhat was left of her family would be
								ruined.
							</p>

							<p>
								On the platform announcing their betrothal, Karris had thought shereally was going to be
								happy. She had admired her fiancé. Gavin always cuta fine figure. She had enjoyed every
								minute of the attention.
							</p>

							<p>
								At dinner that night, Gavin had made a jest to her father about taking
							</p>

							<p>
								Karris back to his rooms and not sleeping a wink. Karris’s father, ordinarilyso
								traditional, the man who’d always sworn his daughter wouldn’t give milkuntil some young
								satrap bought the whole cow, the man who had beatenKarris for giving her virginity to
								Dazen, that man, that hypocrite, thatcoward, had chuckled nervously. Until that moment,
								Karris had been able tostave off her rising panic. At least I won’t have to sleep with
								him untilwe’re married, she’d thought. I’ll be able to fall in love with him in
								thecoming months. I’ll forget Dazen. I’ll forget my shivers when he kissed theback of my
								neck. I’ll forget that swelling in my chest I felt every time hegave that reckless grin.
								Everyone else is right, Dazen isn’t half the manGavin is. I can’t love Dazen after what
								he did.
							</p>

							<p>
								But there had been no escape. Karris had chosen her own kind ofcowardice and gotten
								roaring drunk. Her father had noticed too late—or justin time, depending on how you
								looked at it—and forbade the servants fromgiving her more wine before she could pass out
								at the table. She couldn’teven remember what she’d said at the table, but she did
								remember Gavinhalf-carrying her back to his room. Her father had watched her go
								withempty eyes; he said nothing.
							</p>

							<p>
								She’d thought being drunk would help her be docile, quiet, malleable. Ithad worked, and
								she didn’t know why she was so bitterly disappointedabout that. When she’d turned her
								face away from his kisses, he’d mistakenit for shyness and kissed elsewhere. When he’d
								pulled off her slip and she’dcovered herself with her hands, he’d mistaken it for
								modesty. Modest?When she’d been with Dazen, she’d gloried in his eyes on her. She’d
								beenbold, shameless. She’d felt like a woman—though now she knew she’donly been playing
								at being a woman in so many ways. With Dazen, she’dfelt beautiful. With Gavin, she was
								filled with such unutterable despair itchoked her cries in her own throat. She couldn’t
								remember if she evenprotested, if she’d asked him to stop. She’d wanted to, but her
								memory wasfogged. She didn’t think she had. She’d kept thinking of her father
								saying,“Our family needs this. Without this marriage, we’re ruined.” And shehadn’t
								fought.
							</p>

							<p>
								She remembered crying, though, during. A gentleman would havestopped, but Gavin had been
								drunk and young and horny. There was nogentleness in him. When she wasn’t ready and he
								was hurting her, he’dignored her protests and thrust with a young man’s need.
							</p>

							<p>
								Far from keeping her awake all night as he’d bragged, he’d soonfinished. Then he’d told
								her to leave. The casual cruelty of it had taken herbreath away. And she’d taken it. She
								should have clawed his eyes out.
							</p>

							<p>
								He hadn’t wanted Karris. He’d wanted to show that Dazen couldn’t havewhat rightfully
								belonged to him. Karris might as well have been a tree forhim to piss on after the last
								dog, reclaiming his territory.
							</p>

							<p>
								She’d stumbled through the halls in that beautiful dress with half itsbuttons undone—the
								damned thing required the help of servants to button.She’d been seen, of course. Somehow
								she got home, not their home on BigJasper that had burned to the ground, but to their
								apartments nearby. Herfather had been waiting up, but he didn’t say a word, just stared
								at her. Herroom slave had undressed her with trembling fingers, and when Karris
								hadfinally fallen in bed, the doorway of her room was darkened with herfather’s
								silhouette. He wobbled, leaned against the doorframe.“I could challenge him to a duel,”
								he said. “But he’d kill me, Karris, andthen you’d be ruined. Hopeless. We’d lose
								everything our fathers havefought for for fifty generations. Maybe tomorrow will look
								better.”
							</p>

							<p>
								She’d been winesick for two days, and when she’d emerged, Gavin hadkissed her in public,
								seated her at his right hand, and treated her like aqueen. It was like the night had
								never happened. Or like it had beenbeautiful.
							</p>

							<p>
								Later she’d decided it was because everyone had been talking about thetwo of them as
								such a perfect couple, of how beautiful she was, and Gavinhad decided she suited his
								image. So instead of casting her aside, he’ddecided to go through with the marriage. But
								then he’d left and soon afterfought the final battle at Sundered Rock.
							</p>

							<p>
								When he came back, he seemed like a different man. He treated her witha genuine warmth,
								respect, so unlike the man who’d banished her from hisbedchamber after he took his
								pleasure of her. It made Karris doubt that thenight had happened at all. She could have
								convinced herself that it had allbeen a nightmare—until she found out she was pregnant.
								The very dayshe’d become aware of it, before she could tell him, Gavin had broken
								theirbetrothal.
							</p>

							<p>
								She’d been sixteen, pregnant, and without any prospect of marriage. Inother words, her
								father’s perfect nightmare. As soon as she was certain shewasn’t going to miscarry,
								she’d told her father. He demanded she see thechirurgeons and get it taken care of.
							</p>

							<p>
								For the first time in her life, she’d refused her father. To hell with him.
							</p>

							<p>
								He moved to strike her. She pulled out a pistol. She told him she’d hollowout his skull
								if he dared to strike her. She told him he was a coward. Shewas going to bear Gavin’s
								bastard and let the world know it was his. To hellwith him, and to hell with her father,
								and to hell with everyone. Bearing thatchild would be her first free act, and her
								revenge.
							</p>

							<p>
								Her father had gotten down on his knees and begged. Literally begged.
							</p>

							<p>
								Please save our family, we can’t be the ones who let down all thegenerations of White
								Oaks who sacrificed everything to get us here. We andus, he said. He meant, I and me. He
								was the one who had destroyed thefamily and he knew it. He looked so small and weak,
								cold sweat gleamingoff his balding head. Abruptly, she despised him. He’d been the
								absolutelord over her, and he was disgusting. She refused his pleas, and she
								feltpleasure at the sick, slack despair in his eyes.
							</p>

							<p>
								Two days later, her father kissed the double barrels of a pistol and blewout his own
								brains. His ledger books were all in order. That was how he’dspent those two days. All
								the family properties had been sold to pay offtheir debts, leaving Karris enough to live
								on quietly for the rest of her life,enough to support her illegitimate child. Her father
								had taken care ofeverything. His suicide note had simply explained where the
								remainingmonies were and told Karris where to go if she wanted to bear her child
								insecret. It didn’t beg her to do so. Indeed, there was no emotion in the
								notewhatsoever. No curses, no forgiveness, no regrets. It was as empty as hisskull after
								the musket balls passed through them. Just gore and blackpowder residue. Ordure and
								death. Hollow, messy.
							</p>

							<p>
								She couldn’t stand to stay on the Jaspers, couldn’t endure the pity andthe awkward
								glances. So she’d left, going to a distant cousin’s house deepin the Blood Forest. She’d
								borne the child and given it up immediately, noteven hugging it, asking not even to know
								its gender, and learning onlythrough her hosts’ indiscretion that it was a boy. The
								family adoptingGavin’s get lived nearby, and Karris couldn’t bear to stay, so she’d
								goneback to the Chromeria. She’d lost the baby weight in short order, and heryoung skin
								barely even showed any stretch marks. It was like nothing hadhappened, except for the
								memories clinging to her like hellstone eating hersoul.
							</p>

							<p>
								Fitting that my new dress is black then, huh? A little piece of midnight,like what’s
								inside me.
							</p>

							<p>
								Thought you left the melodrama behind, Karris.Go bend over a fence.I think that’s what
								the king is hoping for.That’ll be a treat for both of us. Hope he enjoys blood.So, what?
								I’m supposed to be thankful that I’m flowing now? Not muchchance—
							</p>

							<p>
								A cramp wracked her in midthought. Karris hunched. Not muchthankfulness here.
							</p>

							<p>
								While she was hunched over, a slip of paper was pushed under the door.
							</p>

							<p>
								Karris picked it up. It was no bigger than her finger.“Orders: assas. KG. Dark. Can’t
								help.” There was an old Dayric rune atthe bottom. It was the agreed symbol to show it
								was from the agent Karrishad been sent to meet. Not well drawn, but correct.
							</p>

							<p>
								It wasn’t much of a code, but they’d never figured Karris would need acode. She was
								supposed to have met the agent in person. He was to identifyhimself by idly tracing part
								of the rune on any surface: a table, dirt,whatever. Karris’s orders were to assassinate
								King Garadul. Secretly. Andher contact wouldn’t be able to help her.
							</p>

							<p>
								Perfect. Karris couldn’t even burn the note, and though small, it wasgrimy. She popped
								it into her mouth with a grimace and swallowed it.
							</p>

							<p>
								Her contact wouldn’t be able to help her. Damn it, Karris, you’ve beenthinking so much
								about the past, you haven’t thought about the present. Inone moment, Corvan had
								understood that someone must want Karris dead.Of all the White’s agents, Karris had to
								be the worst person to send here.Either the White wanted Karris dead, or…
							</p>

							<p>
								There was no other possibility. Or she hoped I’d be kidnapped andmaybe raped? Ludicrous.
							</p>

							<p>
								She knew she frustrated the White at times, but she’d thought thestubborn old woman
								liked her. Then again, the White always played a deepgame. Maybe she thought she could
								use Karris’s death to accomplishsomething else.
							</p>

							<p>
								Karris felt sick to her stomach. It was possible. She wouldn’t havethought it before,
								but she’d sworn to give her life for the White if necessary.Maybe the White had decided
								it was necessary.
							</p>

							<p>
								There was a knock at her door. It was the same routine as before, lots ofdrafters, lots
								of guards. This time, however, several women bearing tins ofpowders and glosses came in.
								With the efficiency of professionals, theymade up Karris, fixed her hair, and applied
								perfume. But they didn’t applyany powder to her eyes or lashes.
							</p>

							<p>
								And soon enough, Karris found out why as one of the slaves took outviolet eye caps.
								Blind them, they’d thought of everything.“If you tear these off, you’ll certainly rip
								your skin,” one of the slavewomen said. “And possibly tear off your entire eyelid. If
								you leave themalone, the king may give you greater freedom, and it won’t hurt your
								eyes.In a few days, they will loosen and come off by themselves.”“At which point you’ll
								reglue them,” Karris said.“Yes.”“What if I get something in my eye?” It would be
								impossible to get itout.“Try not to.”They tried the fit over her eye sockets. The caps
								weren’t a perfect fit.
							</p>

							<p>
								The slave woman, eastern Atashian from her features, scowled. “To makethe caps fit,
								we’re going to have to use extra glue. Extra glue means if youblink, your eyelashes will
								get stuck. King Garadul wants you for yourbeauty, so I don’t want to cut off your
								eyelashes if I can help it. But once weset the caps on your face, they’ll be there for
								days. You really don’t wantyour eyelashes globbed with glue—or stuck in it. So, do you
								want to beblind, irritated, or lashless?”“Lashless, and to hell with Rask,” Karris
								said.The slave pursed her lips. “You’re right. The king might be annoyed.
							</p>

							<p>
								We’ll have to take our chances. Blink right now as much as you can,because you’re going
								to have to not blink for as long as possible.” Withgreat care and globs of glue, they
								put the eye caps on. The glue globs tookcare of the gaps left in the fit.
							</p>

							<p>
								Karris barely dared breathe, holding as still as possible, forcing herselfnot to blink.
								When she finally broke down and had to blink, her lashescaught for a moment in the
								drying glue, but pulled free.“Oh, and try not to cry,” the slave said. “Or you’ll be up
								to your eyeballsin tears. Literally.” She smiled unpleasantly.
							</p>

							<p>
								Hilarious.They put more makeup around her eyes after the glue was fully dried.Then,
								bracketed by drafters and Mirrormen, Karris was whisked throughcamp. The sun had set
								perhaps an hour before, and Karris welcomed thefresh, dry air. Over the smell of her own
								perfume, she was finally able tosmell horses, men, campfires, butchered raw meat,
								cooking meat,sagebrush, oil. Oil? She looked around and saw a supply wagon nearby.
								Oh,oiled swords and gunmetal.
							</p>

							<p>
								With the number of wagons surrounding her own, Karris couldn’t seeenough of the army to
								get a good idea of how many men were marching onGarriston. Even the number of wagons
								didn’t help her. She didn’t knowhow heavily or lightly packed they were, and even if she
								did, the last timeshe’d traveled with an army, she hadn’t paid any attention to such
								things.Young, pampered, terrified, and stupid, it hadn’t occurred to her that suchsimple
								things might be useful to her someday.
							</p>

							<p>
								There were a large number of women diffused throughout the army,carrying fresh-cut wood
								for the fires, standing on the butcher’s wagon,shouting at men to make sure the skinned
								wild javelinas were dispersedfairly, tending the minor injuries inevitable in moving
								thousands, taking inweapons and armor that needed repair for the blacksmiths, rejecting
								thosethat they deemed reparable by the men trying to get someone else to do it.Most of
								the women seemed to be in service roles, however, which eithermeant that King Garadul
								didn’t think much of women or that most werenew recruits. From the wide variety of their
								dress, Karris guessed they camefrom all over the social spectrum. That meant they were
								newer recruits, andwilling ones. These people weren’t all servants he’d brought from
								Kelfing;they were locals. King Garadul had significant support from the Tyreanpeople.
							</p>

							<p>
								From the glimpses out into the growing darkness punctuated by firesscattered randomly as
								stars, it seemed the army sprawled wherever it willed,but Karris was brought quickly to
								an area where perhaps fifty wagons werecircled, leaving only a few avenues between them
								at the points of thecompass where horses would be able to pass, each guarded by
								tenMirrormen with matchlocks. In the middle there was an open space fordefense, small
								falconets pointed out everywhere like a porcupine ready tofire its quills, and then a
								number of large striped pavilions of every color.
							</p>

							<p>
								A cramp caught Karris as she was ushered to the central pavilion. Shehunched, breath
								taken away. She squeezed her eyes tight shut, and the luxincaps cut into her brows and
								cheeks painfully. She smoothed her expressionand waited until the fury of the cramp
								passed. She took a slow breath,mastering the pain. Then she gestured to one of her
								guards, as if she were aqueen and ready to enter now, thank you.
							</p>

							<p>
								The man pulled back the pavilion’s flap, and Karris entered.It must have been some
								dress. Because as soon as Karris stepped inside,conversation ceased.
							</p>

							<p>
								There were perhaps seventy people in the pavilion: slaves, tumblers,jugglers, and
								musicians surrounding perhaps thirty noblemen and -womenseated on cushions around a
								lower table piled high with delicacies andwine. Everyone was colorfully dressed, so much
								so that Karris could telleven through the muting of her dark eye caps. King Rask Garadul
								sat at thehead of the table, of course, rings sparkling from fingers wrapped around
								awine goblet. He had stopped, midsentence, and was staring at her,openmouthed.
							</p>

							<p>
								But Karris barely even saw the king, because at his right hand sat a manlike none she’d
								ever seen. She forced herself to continue walking towardthe king, hips rolling, skirt
								swishing, head up, shoulders loose, as if sheweren’t unnerved.
							</p>

							<p>
								The man was a Tainted, a color wight. Karris had only ever seen one,and that one had
								been in the early stages of his madness. This man wasn’t inthe early stages, but neither
								did he appear mad. He wore a simple luxiat’srobe, but it was dazzling white rather than
								the customary black ofOrholam’s luxiants, that color an admission that they needed
								Orholam’slight most of all. Nor did his face bear any trace of a luxiant’s humility.
							</p>

							<p>
								But at least his face was mostly human—skin and bone and blood.
							</p>

							<p>
								Threads of green luxin lay submerged beneath burn-scarred skin like fadedtattoos, rising
								close to the surface at his cheekbones and brow. At his neck,his body changed. The skin
								was pure luxin of every color of the rainbow.The inside of his elbow, visible as he
								raised his wine goblet in a mockingsalute to Karris, was flexible green luxin, as were
								his other joints and hisneck. Blue luxin plates sat on every surface that didn’t need to
								move. Itmade plate armor on his forearms, formed gauntlets from his very hands,his
								knuckles spiked, his shoulders unnaturally broad under thatblasphemous luxiant’s robe,
								the V of his chest visible through the robeshimmering with reflected light like the sea
								at sunrise. Not plates of blueluxin, then, but actually woven blue luxin, which tripled
								its strength andmade it much less likely to shatter, if one had the skill and patience
								to makeit.
							</p>

							<p>
								Everywhere, yellow luxin flowed between or beneath the other colors,constantly renewing
								whatever was lost to sunlight or natural breakdown.Where plates came together,
								lubricative orange luxin made them slidesmoothly past each other. Red luxin formed
								archaic designs of runes andetchings of eight-pointed stars in thin layers on top of the
								blue plates. Karriscouldn’t see if he had incorporated superviolet into his skin, but
								was certainhe had. After all, in the middle of each palm he’d embedded a flame crystal.
							</p>

							<p>
								Flame crystals, the physical, sealed manifestation of sub-red, usually onlylasted a few
								seconds. Exposure to air made them burst and flame out.
							</p>

							<p>
								This monster had somehow sunk one into each hand and sealed it fromthe air with blue
								luxin so that you could literally see through each of hishands, albeit as though through
								a mirage, the image wavering from the heat,which was the signature of a flame crystal.
								And yet he still retained the useof his fingers, meaning he was either a miracle-working
								healer or it wassome illusion. It had to be. The whole thing was impossible.
							</p>

							<p>
								Karris saw his eyes last, as she came to stand before King Garadul. The
							</p>

							<p>
								Tainted’s eyes were shattered. The halo was broken everywhere. Colorsleaked everywhere
								from the iris, staining the white of his eyes with everycolor. The colors themselves
								swirled constantly, blue coming to the fore asthe Tainted studied Karris, green
								wriggling like a snake through a maze oforange and red.“You,” King Garadul said, “are a
								vision, Karris. A sight for sore eyes.”“And you’re a sore sight for eyes,” she replied,
								smiling sweetly.He laughed. “Not only more beautiful than you were as a girl,
								butsharper, too. Karris, join us. I have a gift for you, but first, I’d like you tomeet
								my right hand.” He gestured to the Tainted. “Karris White Oak, meetthe Crystal Prophet,
								the Polychrome Master, Lord Omnichrome, the ColorPrince, the Eldritch Enlightened.”“Long
								name,” Karris said. “Must take your mother forever to call you todinner.”“You can pick
								your favorite,” the Color Prince said. His voice wasdisconcertingly… human. Strong,
								confident, amused if husky like alongtime haze smoker’s.“The Motley Fool then.”Red
								snapped to the surface of his eyes, quickly replaced by cool,amused blue. “Now, Karris,
								is that the way your father taught you to speak?You used to be so concerned with
								pleasing him. So ladylike, so sweet. Sotame for a green drafter.”“That ended a long time
								ago,” she said. “Who the hell are you? Youdon’t know me.”“Oh, but I do,” the Color
								Prince said. He glanced over at the king.“Oh, sure, go ahead, let her open her present
								early,” Rask Garadul said,pretending exasperation.“Look at me, Karris,” the Crystal
								Prophet said. “Take a moment. Seebeyond your fear, your petty disgust, your ignorance.”
							</p>

							<p>
								Karris bit her tongue. There was something genuine in that raspy voice,some wish to be
								known. So she looked, silently. The body, of course, wasno help, so she studied his
								face. The luxin-stained skin obscured thefeatures, as did the burn scars. One eyebrow
								had grown back in white,whether reacting to fire or luxin, she didn’t know. But there
								was somethingfamiliar.
							</p>

							<p>
								Orholam. The fire. The burn scars. A fist clamped tight around her heartand squeezed.
								She couldn’t draw a breath. It couldn’t be him, he was deadthese sixteen years. But as
								soon as she saw it, she knew it could be no other.“Koios,” Karris said. So this was why
								the White had sent her. Her enemywas her brother. Her knees gave out and she sat heavily
								on the cushionsnext to the king, lest she suffer a very ladylike fainting spell.

								Chapter 68
							</p>

							<p>
								Gavin stopped drafting as the sun sank below the horizon. He could use theambient
								reflected light if he wished, but he was already exhausted. Helooked over the scrub
								brush plain to the south. Karris was out there,somewhere. In all likelihood, he would
								never see her again, never get thechance to tell her the truth. It saddened him more
								than he would haveimagined possible.
							</p>

							<p>
								He turned back and studied the day’s handiwork with disappointment.
							</p>

							<p>
								He’d hoped to erect half a league of wall today, at the least. Instead, he’dlaid nothing
								more than foundation, albeit a full league of it. Surprisinglyenough, it had been
								Aliviana Danavis who’d solved the hardest problem sofar. Or maybe not surprisingly,
								given how smart her father was. Gavin hadbeen walking along the trench the workers were
								digging, spraying yellowinto it. Where there was existing wall, he’d let the yellow flow
								over it likewater, sinking into every crack, reinforcing stone and mortar with
								magic.Where even the old wall’s foundation was gone, he drafted the yellow intosolid
								luxin directly, giving the wall a foundation seven paces wide.Everywhere, he anchored
								the yellow to bedrock with a half-evaporated,tarry thick red luxin.
							</p>

							<p>
								But not only was walking slow, but as soon as the luxin reached thelevel of the ground,
								Gavin had to throw it. Like every other color, yellowhad mass. It weighed about as much
								as water, and with the amounts thatGavin was moving, he was getting crushed. His muscles
								would give out farbefore his drafting ability. Of course, it would only get worse as the
								wallgot taller.
							</p>

							<p>
								He’d begun using scaffolding, but within half an hour it was clear thatthat wouldn’t get
								the wall finished in a month, much less the five days hehad.
							</p>

							<p>
								That was when Liv had sketched out her idea, and like most great ideas,it seemed simple,
								obvious—after she said it.
							</p>

							<p>
								Gavin laid two tracks on either side of the wall, and drafted arms toconnect them. With
								the addition of wheels and a harness to hold him, hewas able to hang suspended in the
								air over the wall. The wheels glidedalong the tracks, so instead of having to move a
								scaffolding every twentypaces, his scaffolding moved with him. Instead of throwing
								luxin, he coulddrop it. It took almost all the physical effort out of the project.
							</p>

							<p>
								By the time he’d properly drafted the harness so that he wasn’t swingingcrazily every
								time he threw more luxin, it was late afternoon. Gavin hadrolled slowly along his
								tracks, sealing the yellow luxin at twenty-paceintervals and laying more yellow over the
								sealed points. With the amount oftime left before sunset, he’d focused on the brute
								drafting, so rather thantackle the intellectual challenges of drafting the interior of
								the wall, he’ddecided to draft as much foundation as he could.
							</p>

							<p>
								He made huge progress, but it was still hard to say whether he wasgoing to finish the
								whole project in time. If he finished an entire tall,impregnable wall by the time Rask
								Garadul’s army arrived, except for twohundred paces in the middle, the entire endeavor
								would be vanity.
							</p>

							<p>
								Gavin lowered himself to the ground. He wobbled a little as heapproached Corvan Danavis,
								who was holding their horses. Corvan lookedconcerned. “Just a long time off my feet,”
								Gavin said.
							</p>

							<p>
								Corvan accepted that silently. A few blocks later as the sun was fadingout of the sky,
								he said, “So… Karris was captured.”“Mm-hm,” Gavin said, not making eye contact.“So
								you’ve put all that behind you?”Gavin said nothing.“Good. I always thought she was the
								biggest threat to your plan. Enoughreasons to hate both of you, and rash enough to tear
								it all down withoutthinking. So you’ll antagonize Rask and hope he kills her to show
								he’sserious?”“Damn you,” Gavin said.“Oh, not past it, then?” Corvan asked.
							</p>

							<p>
								He wasn’t serious about getting Karris killed. Gavin knew that. Corvanmight always
								understand the cutthroat thing to do, but that didn’t mean healways did it.“So she still
								doesn’t know?”“No. That’s why I broke our betrothal.”“Because she was the mostly likely
								to see through you, or some otherreason?” Corvan asked.“We destroyed her. Dazen burned
								down her home and the war took therest. I didn’t realize she had nothing—and I should
								have. By the time Ioffered to restore her family’s fortune, it seemed like an insult.
								She spat onme and disappeared for a year. When she came back, she was different.”“I
								noticed. A Blackguard. An astounding achievement. But you didn’tanswer my question.”
							</p>

							<p>
								Though it was getting darker, the streets were comfortably warm, and ifanything, the
								crowds were getting thicker, people lighting lamps outsidetheir own homes or shops.
								Others were relaxing, drinking on the flat roofsof their houses. It was almost as if
								doom weren’t impending.
							</p>

							<p>
								Gavin looked around and made sure his voice was low enough not tocarry. “I’ve lied to
								everyone. I’ve lied so much sometimes I forget who Iwas. With everything my brother and
								I did to Karris… I couldn’t—well,shit, she’s seen us both naked, hasn’t she? If anyone
								would know, shewould. It would be the quickest way to destroy everything.”“True enough,
								but you were going to say something else,” Corvan said,looking down at his saddle,
								giving Gavin that shred of privacy.“I thought about it, you know? How to marry her and
								still deceive her.
							</p>

							<p>
								Or, failing that, how to show her that she had no choice but to keep mysecret. In the
								end, she was the one thing I wasn’t willing to defile. After Iran away, she fell in love
								with my brother. If she figured out the truth anddecided to destroy me…” Gavin shrugged.
							</p>

							<p>
								Now Corvan did look him in the eye. “I don’t know whether to admireyou all the more, or
								to be horrified that you’d be so stupid.”“I usually opt to admire me all the more,”
								Gavin said, grinning.Corvan gave a grudging smile, but didn’t laugh.They rode through
								the streets as quickly as they could without crushinganyone, and arrived at the
								Travertine Palace as darkness set in. Ironfist wasstanding at the gate.
								Uncharacteristically, he had a huge grin on his face.“High Lord Prism,” he said. “Dinner
								awaits.”
							</p>

							<p>
								Gavin scowled. If Ironfist was grinning, it meant something awkward,unpleasant, or
								vexing was coming. But he wasn’t going to ask. With thatgrin, Ironfist would just grin
								bigger and enjoy being mysterious. Fine.Gavin started walking toward the private dining
								hall.“High Lord,” Ironfist interjected. “The great hall.”It was only a few steps away.
								Gavin barely had time to think why theymight possibly need the great hall for dinner
								before he was inside theantechamber to the great domed hall.
							</p>

							<p>
								The great hall of the Travertine Palace, though perhaps only a third thesize of the
								Chromeria’s great hall, was one of the wonders of the old world.The doorways were
								enormous bulbous horseshoe arches, striped green andwhite, speaking of the days when
								half of Tyrea had been a Parian province.Travertine and white marble alternated
								everywhere: in the chessboardpattern of the floor, in intricate geometric shapes on the
								walls, and in oldParian runes that decorated the bases of the eight great wooden pillars
								thatsupported the ceiling, their layout an eight-pointed star. Each pillar was afull
								five paces thick—atasifusta, the widest trees in the world—and nonenarrowed perceptibly
								before reaching the ceiling. The wood was said tohave been the gift of an Atashian king,
								five hundred years before. Even thenit had been precious. Now they were extinct, the
								last grove cut down duringthe Prisms’ War. Gavin had never found out who had done that.
								When hearrived in Ru, the grove was simply gone. His commanders—Dazen’scommanders—had
								sworn the last trees were standing when they left thecity. Gavin’s commanders after the
								war had sworn the trees were gone whenthey arrived.
							</p>

							<p>
								What made the atasifusta unique was that its sap had properties likeconcentrated red
								luxin. The trees took a hundred years to reach full size—these giants had been several
								hundreds of years old when they’d been cut.But after they reached maturity, holes could
								be drilled in the trunk, and ifthe tree was large enough, the sap would drain slowly
								enough to feedflames. These eight giants each bore a hundred twenty-seven holes,
								thenumber apparently significant once, but that significance lost. On first look,it
								appeared that the trees were aflame, but the flame was constant and neverconsumed the
								wood, which was ghostly ivory white aside from theblackened soot smudges above each
								flame hole. Gavin knew that the flamescouldn’t be truly eternal, but after allegedly
								burning day and night for fivehundred years, these atasifustas’ flames gave little
								indication of going outanytime soon. Perhaps the flames nearer the top were a little
								duller thanthose lower as the sap settled in the wood, but Gavin wouldn’t have bet onit.
							</p>

							<p>
								When the wood wasn’t mature, it made incredible firewood. A bundlethat a man could carry
								in his arms would warm a small hut all winter. Nowonder it was extinct.
							</p>

							<p>
								No torches were necessary in the great hall, of course, but outside thestained glass
								windows, each also a horseshoe arch, torches burned so thatthe colored glass would glow
								day or night, white or green or red.
							</p>

							<p>
								Again, the colors, the shape itself, all were meaningful to the peoplewho’d built this
								wonder, and Gavin had no idea what any of it meant. Itgave him a sense of
								insignificance. He didn’t think anything he made wouldsurvive five hundred years after
								he was gone. Indeed, it was mostly luckthat his brother Gavin hadn’t razed this very
								wonder when he’d destroyedthis city.
							</p>

							<p>
								As Gavin walked in, his eyes were pulled from the majesty of thoseatasifusta pillars to
								the men and women seated at the great table, every faceturned toward him. He was
								distracted briefly as he stepped past twinshadows flanking the halls. His head snapped
								to the side, expecting anassassin. No, it was a Blackguard. One on either side of the
								doorway, anddozens more around the hall, all of them familiar to him. Blackguards?Here?
							</p>

							<p>
								Oh, the ships of those to be Freed have come. Ironfist must havecommanded all these
								Blackguards to come along.
							</p>

							<p>
								His eyes returned to the table. There were at least two hundred drafterswaiting for him.
								A small class, as the White had told him. What she hadn’ttold him was who was in this
								class. Gavin knew all of them by face, andmost of them by name. He recognized Izem Red
								and Izem Blue, SamilaSayeh, Maros Orlos, the discontiguous bichrome Usef Tep whom
								theycalled the Purple Bear, Deedee Falling Leaf, the Parian sisters Tala andTayri, Javid
								Arash, Talon Gim, Eleleph Corzin, Bas the Simple, DalosTemnos the Younger, Usem the
								Wild, Evi Grass, Flamehands, and OdessCarvingen. Everywhere he looked, heroes from the
								Prisms’ War, from bothsides. These were some of the most talented drafters in the Seven
								Satrapies,and they represented every single one of the Seven Satrapies too, even
								theIlytians were represented, albeit only by Flamehands, and Eleleph Corzinwas Abornean.
							</p>

							<p>
								Gavin stopped in his tracks, disbelieving. Every year, some draftersfrom the war were
								Freed, but Gavin hadn’t had this many of the greats sinceimmediately after it, when so
								many had been pushed to the brink by theamount of power they’d handled in fighting.
							</p>

							<p>
								These drafters had all been young during the war, and Gavin had knownand dreaded that
								they’d start passing, but so many, all in one year?“We had us a pact,” Usem the Wild
								said, answering Gavin’s obviousconfusion. “Some of us who fought together. Said once the
								first of us had togo, we’d all go together. Wanted another year or two, myself, but
								better togo out on top, isn’t it?”“Better to go out sane,” the Purple Bear
								growled.“Better to go together,” Samila Sayeh said. “And stop making Deedeefeel bad.”
							</p>

							<p>
								Indeed, Deedee Falling Leaf did look worse than most of them. Her skinwas tinged a
								permanent green, and the halo of her eyes was straining underthe green that had
								overwhelmed her formerly blue irises. She smiledweakly. “Lord Prism, it’s an honor. I’ve
								been looking forward to thisFreeing for a long time.” She curtsied, choosing to ignore,
								as most of theold warriors did, that she had been on the other side of the war than
								Gavin.
							</p>

							<p>
								The rest of them followed her example, bowing or curtseying in theformal style of their
								homelands. Gavin bowed formally, meeting their eyes,careful that he too gave equal
								respect to drafters from each side.
							</p>

							<p>
								Inside, as it always did, his heart broke. He wanted to tell those who’dfought beside
								him that it was him, that he wasn’t Gavin, that it had all beenfor the best. Instead, he
								sat with them, finding himself next to the irascibleUsem the Wild as the slaves brought
								out steaming platters of food and coolflagons of citrus juices and wine.“When I told
								some of the others”—Usem nodded grudgingly over at the
							</p>

							<p>
								Izems and Samila, who’d fought for Gavin—“they thought it would be agood year for them
								too.”“We wished, Lord Prism, to perhaps help the Seven Satrapies put the…war behind us,”
								Samila Sayeh said, diplomatically stopping herself fromcalling it the False Prism’s War.
								“We’ve actually become good friends.”“Personally,” Maros Orlos, the shortest Ruthgari
								Gavin had ever seen,said, “I’m glad to have a Freeing without all the trappings. The
								fireworksand speeches and posturing by satraps and satrapahs and upstart lordlingswho
								won’t ever have to fulfill the Pact themselves. A Freeing’s holy. Itought to be between
								a man, the Prism, and Orholam. The rest isdistractions.”“Distractions? Like dinner with
								the Prism and your Freeing class?” Izem
							</p>

							<p>
								Red asked. He was Parian, lean as a whip and with a wit to match. He stillwore his
								ghotra folded so it resembled a cobra’s hood, a style he’d pickedup as a
								seventeen-year-old drafter, and endured incessant teasing for it.He’d been called a
								poser until the first battle when his lightning-like strikes,fireballs as fast as an
								arrow, and decimation of the enemy’s ranks hadsilenced all teasing once and for all.
							</p>

							<p>
								Maros opened his mouth to protest, realized he was about to spar with
							</p>

							<p>
								Izem Red, and turned his attention back to his food.
							</p>

							<p>
								Tala, an older Parian woman with short white hair and red haloscompressing brown irises,
								said, “You know, High Lord Prism, CommanderIronfist told us you have a little project
								you’re working on. Somethingabout that reminds me of that old poem about the Wanderer.
								How does itgo, some work…?”
							</p>

							<p>
								It was a famous poem; they all knew it. She didn’t even need to say thewhole thing. She
								was offering their help on Gavin’s wall. “That would bewonderful—” Gavin began.
							</p>

							<p>
								Bas the Simple, the odd Tyrean polychrome, interrupted, his headcocked to the side. “
								‘Some work of noble note may yet be done, notunbecoming men that strove with gods.’
								Gevison, The Wanderer’s LastJourney, lines sixty-three and sixty-four.” He looked up,
								saw everyonelooking at him, and looked down shyly.“That would be marvelous,” Gavin said.
								“I understand if anyone hasobjections and doesn’t wish to join me, but if you would like
								to… I’d reallyappreciate it.” It was a total gift, and one that wouldn’t cost most of
								themanything. Not all of these drafters were at the edge of death, most of themwere
								ridiculously powerful, and many were wonderfully subtle in theirchromaturgy. Their help
								would make all the difference.
							</p>

							<p>
								Of course, these were also all the people who had known Gavin and
							</p>

							<p>
								Dazen best. If anyone were likely to discover that Gavin was a fraud, he orshe was in
								this room. And with their Freeing looming, the discoverer wouldhave little or nothing to
								lose in exposing him.
							</p>

							<p>
								Gavin’s chest tightened and he smiled over his fear, as if he weresmiling at how
								brilliant and strangely simple Bas was. Smiles returned tohim from every side of the
								table. Some of those smiles, Gavin knew, mustsurely be serpents’ smiles, but he had no
								way of knowing which ones. Whowould be more likely to destroy him? Those who thought he
								was the manwho had been their friend and learned he had usurped Gavin’s place, orthose
								who’d fought for him and had believed him dead and now learnedthat he’d betrayed them?
							</p>

							<p>
								Bas the Simple was staring at Gavin, not smiling, his head cocked to theside, oddly
								perceptive eyes studying everything.
							</p>

							<p>
								Chapter 69“The boy’s gone,” Ironfist said. It was almost midnight. They were standingon
								the roof of the Travertine Palace, looking over the bay. “Kip,” he said, asif there were
								some other boy. He didn’t say “your son,” though.
							</p>

							<p>
								Great how everyone has to dance around my misdeeds. My misdeeds.
							</p>

							<p>
								Right. Thanks, brother. “Why wasn’t I told?” Gavin asked. He’d spent allnight pretending
								to be his brother with drafters who knew them both, andhaving to pretend to be enjoying
								himself. It was disconcerting. He’denjoyed his old enemies’ company, and felt constantly
								like his vision wasblurring. The men and women he’d hated when he’d been Dazen had
								beenquite pleasant. A few of Dazen’s old friends, though not all, had had anedge on all
								their interactions that made them unattractive. Gavin looked atmen and women whom he had
								arranged to live and work far from theJaspers just so they wouldn’t endanger him and
								thought, I ruined you andyou never even knew it. And I missed you.“We just discovered it
								a few minutes ago. This note was sitting out. Theother was tucked under the bedsheets.”
							</p>

							<p>
								Smart. Kip accomplished exactly what he was trying to do: he boughthimself time. Kept us
								from looking for him all day. Gavin extended hishand, knowing Ironfist would have the
								notes. Ironfist handed them over.
							</p>

							<p>
								The important one read, “I’m Tyrean and young. More help as a spythan here. No one will
								suspect me. Will try to find Karris.”
							</p>

							<p>
								A spy? Orholam strike me. “Any other news?” Gavin asked.“He took a horse and a stick of
								coins.”“So he could get himself into even more trouble than simply headinginto an enemy
								camp armed only with delusions,” Gavin said.
							</p>

							<p>
								Ironfist didn’t respond. He generally ignored statements of the obvious.“The Danavis
								girl is gone as well. The stableman says she asked him for ahorse, but he turned her
								down. Sounds like she found the notes and wentafter him.”
							</p>

							<p>
								Gavin stared out over the bay. The Guardian, the statue guarding theentrance of the bay,
								and through whose legs every sailor passed, held aspear in one hand and a torch in the
								other. The torch was kept by a yellowdrafter whose entire job was to keep it filled with
								liquid yellow. Specialgrooves cut in the glass slowly exposed the yellow luxin to air
								and caused itto shimmer back into light. Mirrors collected and directed the light out
								intothe night, spinning slowly on gears driven by a windmill when there waswind and
								draft animals when there wasn’t. Tonight, the beam illuminatedthe misty night air,
								cutting great swathes in the darkness. It was what everydrafter was supposed to do:
								bring Orholam’s light to the darkest corners ofthe world.
							</p>

							<p>
								It was what Kip was trying to do.Ironfist said, “If he came into my camp and kept a low
								profile, Iwouldn’t suspect him as a spy.”
							</p>

							<p>
								Because he’d make a marvelously bad spy, perhaps? “About our spies,what have you
								learned?”“Governor Crassos very innocently came to inspect the docks, carrying avery
								innocent-looking and strangely heavy bag. He looked awfully pleasedto see me,” Ironfist
								said.“You only get sarcastic when you’re mad,” Gavin said. “Go ahead. Letme have it.”“I
								swore to protect Kip, Lord Prism, but first, the spies—”“You can call me Gavin when I’ve
								been stupid,” Gavin said flatly.“The spies report—”“Out with it, for Orholam’s
								sake.”Ironfist clenched his jaw, then willed himself to relax. “I need to go afterhim,
								Gavin, which means I can’t be here, helping with the defense anddirecting my
								people.”“And you’re Parian and huge and pretty much the opposite ofinconspicuous, so if
								you go after him—as your honor demands—you’llmost likely be killed, which will not only
								mean that you’re killed, whichyou don’t particularly desire, but it also means you will
								have failed toprotect Kip, which would be the only point of going after him in the
								firstplace. And you can’t delegate the mission to anyone else because youpromised to
								protect him personally, and besides, any other Blackguardwould stand out nearly as much
								as you do.” It wasn’t that Blackguards weredarker-skinned than Tyreans and had kinky
								rather than wavy or straighthair. There had been enough mixing over the centuries that
								quite a fewTyreans had both traits. Even Kip could still make a good spy despite hisblue
								eyes; Tyreans were used to minority ethnicities from all the peoplewho’d stayed after
								the war. The problem was that ebony-skinned, extremelyphysically fit drafters who exuded
								danger from their very pores were goingto stand out anywhere. Blackguards would stand
								out among an army ofParian drafters.“That’s pretty much it,” Ironfist admitted, the edge
								of his anger bluntedby Gavin acknowledging exactly why he was angry.“What else did you
								learn from our spies?” Gavin asked, shunting aside
							</p>

							<p>
								Ironfist’s concerns for the moment.
							</p>

							<p>
								Ironfist seemed just as happy to not be talking about his dilemma.“Some of them have
								come from King Garadul’s camp, and I think ourproblems are bigger than we realized.” He
								pushed his ghotra off his head,scrubbing his scalp with his fingertips. “It’s
								religious,” he said.“I didn’t think you were much for religion,” Gavin said, trying to
								injecta bit of levity.“Why would you think that? I speak with Orholam constantly.”“
								‘Orholam, what did I do to deserve this?’ ” Gavin suggested, thinkinghe was kidding.“No.
								Seriously,” Ironfist said.“Oh.” Ironfist, devout?“But you know how that is. You speak
								with him all the time as well. Youare his chosen.”“It’s different for me.” Very very
								different, apparently. “But sorry to jest.
							</p>

							<p>
								Religion?”“This isn’t just some political matter of calling himself a king. Rask
							</p>

							<p>
								Garadul wants to upend everything we’ve accomplished since Lucidoniuscame. Everything.”
							</p>

							<p>
								An indefinable dread settled in Gavin’s stomach. “The old gods.”“The old gods,” Ironfist
								said.“Get Kip back, Commander. Do whatever you have to. If anyonecomplains about your
								methods, they’ll have to go through me. If you can,save the girl too. I owe her father a
								debt I can never explain.”
							</p>

							<p>
								Gavin slept little and fitfully. He never slept much, but it was alwaysworse as the
								Freeing approached. He hated this time of year. Hated thecharade. His chest felt tight
								as he lay in his bed. Maybe he should have lethis brother win. Maybe Gavin would have
								done a better job of all of this. Atthe very least, he wouldn’t be here now.
							</p>

							<p>
								Nonsense.And yet he couldn’t help but wonder if Gavin would have been a better
							</p>

							<p>
								Prism than he was. Gavin had always borne burdens of responsibility betterthan Dazen
								had. It didn’t even seem like a weight to his older brother. Likethe man had been
								without self-doubt. Dazen had always envied Gavin that.
							</p>

							<p>
								The morning came none too soon. Dazen sat up and put on his face,
							</p>

							<p>
								Gavin once more. He felt that stab of pain radiating through his chest,tightening his
								throat. He couldn’t do this.
							</p>

							<p>
								Nonsense. He was just missing Kip, and Karris, and was worried for
							</p>

							<p>
								Corvan’s daughter and dreading the exhausting drafting he was going tohave to do all day
								long. There was nothing to do but get on with it.
							</p>

							<p>
								After taking his time with his ablutions—why had Gavin had to be sucha dandy?—he ate and
								rode to the wall. He was greeted by a young orangedrafter.
							</p>

							<p>
								The drafter was one of the tragically young who couldn’t handle thepower. An addict. He
								couldn’t have been twenty years old, mountainParian, but he didn’t wear the ghotra,
								instead wearing his hair in dreadlocks,bound back with a leather thong. The rest of his
								clothing spoke of similarrejection of traditional attire—any tradition. Oranges tended
								to see exactlyhow others liked things to be. In most cases they used that to
								theiradvantage, becoming as slick as their luxin. But in some cases they defiedevery
								convention they saw, becoming artists and rebels. Given how theman’s clothes somehow
								worked together to look good despite theirdisparate origins, and that all the colors and
								textures complemented eachother, Gavin guessed this one was an artist. This young man’s
								orange halowas thin with strain, though. He definitely couldn’t have made it until
								thenext Freeing.“Lord Prism,” the young man said. “How can I help?”The sun had barely
								cleared the horizon, and all the drafters who werecapable of drafting without hurting
								themselves or losing control hadgathered at the wall. The local workmen seemed stunned
								to be surroundedby so many of them.“What’s your name?” Gavin asked. He didn’t think he’d
								even seen thisyoung man before.“Aheyyad.”“So you are an artist,” Gavin said.Aheyyad
								smiled. “Not much choice, with the grandmother I had.”Gavin tilted his head.“Sorry, I
								thought you knew. My grandmother is Tala. She knew I wasgoing to be an orange and an
								artist by the time I was four years old. Sheforced my mother to rename me.”“Tala can be
								very, ahem, persuasive,” Gavin said.The boy grinned.A boy going to the Freeing at the
								same time as his grandmother. Therewas a tale of woe just under the surface there, a
								family’s grief, the loss oftwo generations at once, but no need to prod that now. All
								things arebrought to light in time. “I need an artist,” Gavin said. “Can you
								workfast?”“I’d better,” Aheyyad said.“Are you any good?” Gavin already knew that Aheyyad
								was or Corvanwouldn’t have sent him. He wanted to know whether the young man wouldbe
								bold or tentative when faced with something so vast.“I’m the best,” Aheyyad said.
								“What’s the project?”Gavin smiled. He loved artists. In small doses. “I’m building a
								wall.
							</p>

							<p>
								Work with the architect to make sure you don’t screw up anythingfunctional, but your
								task is to make this wall scary. You can commandeerany of the old drafters to help you.
								I’ll give you some drawings we have ofRathcaeson. If it can resemble those, do it.
								You’ll tell the blues how to holdthe forms. I’ll fill them with yellow luxin. I’m doing
								functional things first.We can attach and integrate whatever you design in two or three
								days.”“How big can I make… whatever I make?”“We’ve got a couple leagues of wall.”“So
								you’re saying… big.”“Huge,” Gavin said. Having the artist only design the forms would
								alsokeep the young man from having to draft anything at all, which with howclose Aheyyad
								was to breaking the halo would possibly save his life.
							</p>

							<p>
								It took until noon before they were ready to start the drafting. Gavin hadasked all the
								old warriors to look at the plans of the wall, and not a few ofthem had come up with
								suggestions. Those suggestions had coveredeverything from expanding the latrines—and
								making sure the raw sewagecould be routed onto their enemies by emptying the pots
								suddenly throughchutes out the front of the wall—to reworking the mounts for the
								cannonsand adding furnaces to heat the shot at several of the stations. Heated shotwas
								wonderful for setting fire to siege engines. Someone else suggestedtexturing the floors
								and providing gutters not only outside for rainwater,which had already been considered,
								but also within the wall itself for blood.
							</p>

							<p>
								Many good suggestions, and quite a few bad ones. The wall should bebigger, smaller,
								wider, taller. There should be space for more cannons, morearchers, more beds in the
								hospital, the barracks should be within the wall,and so on.
							</p>

							<p>
								At noon, Gavin was rigged back into his harness and lifted off theground. The others
								swarmed around him, drafting forms, steadying hisharness. Then he set to work.
							</p>

								Chapter 70
							</p>

							<p>
								It wasn’t until two days later, as Kip and Liv came within sight of KingGaradul’s army,
								plopped over the plain and fouling the river like anenormous cow pie, that he realized
								how deeply, incredibly, brilliantly stupidhis plan was.
							</p>

							<p>
								I’m going to march in there and rescue Karris?More like waddle in there.At the top of a
								small hill, they sat on the horse, which seemed gratefulfor the break, and scanned the
								mass of humanity before them. It wasimmense. Kip had never tried to estimate a crowd,
								and never seen one thislarge.“What do you think, sixty or seventy thousand?” he asked
								Liv.“More than a hundred, I’d guess.”“How are we going to find Karris in that?” he
								asked. What did I expect?
							</p>

							<p>
								A sign, perhaps? “Captured drafter here”?
							</p>

							<p>
								Most of the camp was chaotic, people pitching lean-tos against wagons,those who had
								tents screaming at each other over who got which spot,children running around, clogging
								the spaces between tents and wagons andlivestock. The sky was still light, though the
								sun had gone down, andcampfires were being started all over the plain. Kip could hear
								peoplesinging nearby. Men were swimming and bathing in the river, downstreamof where
								some soldiers had hastily erected a corral. The animals dirtied thewater, but no one
								seemed to care. Other men stood on the bank, urinatingdirectly into the water. The color
								of the river upstream and downstream ofthe camp was distinctly different. People were
								carrying buckets of watereverywhere, taken directly from the river.
							</p>

							<p>
								Maybe I’ll only drink wine.More importantly, the smell of meat cooking permeated the
								air.Kip’s stomach complained. They’d gone through his food faster thanhe’d
								thought—mostly, he had gone through it faster—and now he hadnothing. Well, except for a
								stick of danars I stole with half a year’s wageson it.
							</p>

							<p>
								Oh. That.“We split up,” Liv said. “You head directly for the center of the camp.
								Iimagine that’s where the king will have his tents. She’s important, so theymight be
								keeping her close. I’ll go look for where the drafters are camping.A captured drafter
								will probably be watched by other drafters. She’s got tobe in one place or the other.
								We’ll meet back here in, say, three hours?”
							</p>

							<p>
								Kip nodded his acquiescence, impressed. He would have been lost onhis own.
							</p>

							<p>
								And almost instantly, she slipped off the horse and was gone. Nohesitation, no
								second-guessing. Kip watched her go. He was hungry.
							</p>

							<p>
								Leading the big, docile horse, tugging and pulling the beast as it tried tomunch grass
								to the right and left, Kip approached at one of the larger fires.Not one but two
								javelinas were roasting on spits over the fire, and as Kipstared, swallowing, one of the
								fattest women he had ever seen sawed off afully cooked leg with a few deft strokes at
								the joint. The smell was rich,succulent, savory, mouthwatering, lovely, astounding,
								mesmerizing,debilitating. Kip couldn’t move—until he saw her raise the meat to her
								lips.“Pardon me!” he said, louder than he meant. Others around the firelooked up.“Didn’t
								smell it,” the fat lady said, then she sank her teeth into greasyham. Kip died a little.
								Then more as the hard men and women around thefire laughed at him. The fat woman, leg in
								one hand, long knife in the other,grinned between bites. She had at least three chins,
								her facial featuresdisappearing into the fat that encased her like an awkward child
								surroundedby a crowd of bullies. Her linen skirt could have served as a tent.
								Literally.She turned away from Kip, slipping the knife back into a sheath and puttingher
								hand back to turning the spit. Her butt was more than a jiggly haunch; itwas
								architecture.“Pardon me,” Kip said, recovering. “I was wondering if I could buysome
								dinner. I’ve got money.”
							</p>

							<p>
								Ears perked up all around the fire at that. Kip wondered suddenly if he’dpicked a good
								fire to stop at. Were the men everywhere in the camp asscruffy as these ones?
							</p>

							<p>
								Kip looked around. Uh, yes, actually they were.Oh shit.He fumbled with the leather money
								belt holding the stick of tin danars.
							</p>

							<p>
								He’d grabbed the money belt because it already had money in it and wouldbe easier to
								transport than loose coins. The stick was a great way to carrymoney. Cut square to fit
								the square hole in the middle of danars, and ofuniform length so people could rapidly
								count their own money—scaleswere still used to count others’ money, of course—it was
								convenient andkept your money from jangling at every step as they did in a purse. Plus
								thesticks could be bound in leather for attaching to a belt or hiding inside ofclothes,
								as Kip’s was. He’d seen the gleam of this stick and grabbed it.
							</p>

							<p>
								But as Kip pulled the open end of the money stick out to pull off one tindanar coin, he
								saw something was very wrong. He froze. The weight hadbeen right, or at least close
								enough that he hadn’t thought about it, but thecoin he pulled out wasn’t tin. A danar
								was about what a worker would makefor a day’s labor. An unskilled labor like his mother
								would only make half adanar a day. He’d assumed the stick he grabbed was full of the tin
								coins,each worth eight danars.
							</p>

							<p>
								Instead, he’d grabbed a stick of silver quintars. Slightly wider incircumference, but
								only half as thick, and the metal slightly lighter than tin,the silver coins were worth
								twenty danars each. A stick of silver quintarsheld fifty of the coins, twice as many as
								the twenty-five tin coins that wouldfit on the same stick. So instead of stealing two
								hundred danars from theTravertine Palace—an already princely sum—Kip had stolen a
								thousand.And he’d just pulled out one right in front of everyone, making it clear hehad
								more.
							</p>

							<p>
								Conversation ceased. In the dancing light of the fire, more than a feweyes gleamed like
								wolves’.
							</p>

							<p>
								Kip tucked the rest of the money belt away, praying no one had seenhow full it was. What
								did it matter? His life might be worth less than eventhe one silver quintar. “I’ll take
								the other leg,” he said.
							</p>

							<p>
								The fat woman let go of the spit and reached her hand out.“I’ll need nineteen danars
								back,” Kip said. A full day’s wages should bemore than three times what the javelina leg
								cost.
							</p>

							<p>
								She chortled. “We run a charity house here, we do. Look like luxiats,huh? Ten.”“Ten
								danars, for a meal?” Kip asked, not believing she was serious.“You can go hungry if you
								wanna. You ain’t gonna starve,” the womansaid.
							</p>

							<p>
								The injustice of this whale calling him fat and the impossibility of doingmuch about it
								paralyzed Kip. He gritted his teeth, glaring around the fire,and handed over the
								quintar.
							</p>

							<p>
								The leviathan took the quintar and held it between her teeth, bending itslightly. If it
								were a counterfeit, tin coated with silver, it would give thecurious crackling sound
								unique to bending tin. Satisfied between the weightand the texture that it was real, she
								tucked the coin away. She took a swigfrom a glass jug, set it down, and then sawed a leg
								off the javelina. Whileshe was working, Kip noticed that some of the men around the fire
								haddisappeared.
							</p>

							<p>
								No doubt he was going to find them in the spreading darkness, waitingfor him. Orholam,
								they had seen the rest of the stick.
							</p>

							<p>
								Nor were the remaining men and women looking at him in a terriblyfriendly manner. They
								sat on their bags, on stumps, or on the ground,mostly watching him quietly. A few drank
								from wineskins or aleskins,murmuring to each other. A glassy-eyed woman was lying with
								her head ina long-haired, balding, unshaven man’s lap, stroking his thigh. Both
								werestaring at him.
							</p>

							<p>
								The whale handed Kip the javelina leg.Kip looked at her, waiting.She stared blandly back
								at him from beneath her layers of blubber.A few weeks ago, Kip would have backed off. He
								was used to peopletreating him like dirt. Ignoring him or bullying him. But he
								couldn’timagine Gavin Guile being bullied, not even when the odds were stackedagainst
								him. Kip might be a bastard, but if had one drop of the Prism’sblood, there was no way
								he could knuckle under. “I need my ten danars,”Kip said.
							</p>

							<p>
								The drunk woman across the fire laughed suddenly, uncontrollably, untilshe started
								snorting and laughing harder. Not just drunk, then.“Do I look rich enough to have ten
								danars?” the whale asked.“You can cut that danar in half.”
							</p>

							<p>
								She drew her knife and shrugged, stepping close to Kip. She reeked ofgrain alcohol.
								“Sorry, got no knife.”
							</p>

							<p>
								Kip understood instantly. Several of the men were sitting up, not onlypaying more
								attention, but getting ready to hop to their feet. They weren’twaiting only to laugh at
								him, knowing this whale would cheat him. Theywere waiting, knowing the whale would cheat
								him, to see if he was avictim. Would Kip meekly accept being cheated? If he was a
								victim, he wasa mark. If he had one quintar, he might have more.
							</p>

							<p>
								But what could he do? Give back the food? No, she wouldn’t give himthe quintar back
								regardless. If he left, he’d confirm his weakness. Someonewould be waiting for him in
								the darkness. What would they do if heattacked her? If, without warning, he punched her
								in her blubbery face ashard as he could?
							</p>

							<p>
								They’d attack him, of course. And after they beat him, then they’d robhim.
							</p>

							<p>
								If he ran away, even if he got away, he’d lose his horse, and he had toomuch trouble
								mounting the beast to leap into the saddle and ride away—even if it hadn’t been the most
								placid creature on earth, unlikely to gallopeven with hell on its heels.“Fine,” Kip
								said. He turned as if to go, but instead grabbed her glass jug.“I’d like to have a drink
								with dinner. You keep the rest. For the greatservice.” He smelled the jug. As he
								thought, it was grain alcohol. He took aswig to look tough and had to school his face to
								stillness when it set hismouth on fire. Then his throat. Then his stomach.
							</p>

							<p>
								The men who’d been shifting to get up settled back down.“Mind if I sleep here tonight?”
								Kip asked.“It’ll cost you,” the man who was balding up front and had hair halfwaydown
								his back said.“Sure,” Kip said. He wasn’t nearly as hungry as he’d been a few
								minutesago, but he forced himself to eat the greasy javelina leg. As the rest of
								thejavelina cooked, the other men and women came and took slices.
							</p>

							<p>
								As Kip finished, he sucked his fingers and walked toward his horse. Hegot far enough
								that he began to hope that they would simply let him leave.“What are you doing?” the
								balding man demanded.“I need to rub down my horse,” Kip said. “It’s been a long
								day.”“You don’t need to go anywhere, and I don’t want you near my horse.”“Your horse,”
								Kip said.“That’s right.” The man bared blackened teeth at Kip—not quite a smile,not
								quite like he was going to bite him—and drew a knife.“We’ll be needing that coin belt,
								too,” another man said.The women around the fire simply watched, impassive. No one
								movedto help. Several other men joined the two already facing Kip. Kip lookedinto the
								darkness, his vision spoiled by the fire, but still he could see severaldark shapes
								waiting for him.
							</p>

							<p>
								Give them what you have, and maybe you’ll escape with a beating, Kip.
							</p>

							<p>
								You know you’re not getting out of here with everything. Stall for time,maybe there’s
								some kind of camp guards here who might save you.“Evernight take you,” Kip said. He
								smashed the top off the jug of grainalcohol on the edge of a wagon wheel.“Fool boy,” the
								balding man said. “Most people keep the handle if theydo that, not smash it off.”
							</p>

							<p>
								Kip lunged, splashing grain alcohol over the man. The balding mangrimaced, rubbing
								stinging eyes, switching his knife to his left hand. “Youknow what? I’m going to kill
								you for that,” he said.
							</p>

							<p>
								With a yell, Kip charged.It was the last thing the man expected. He was still rubbing
								his eyes. Heraised an arm to fend off a blow, but Kip dove at his stomach, past
								theknife, spearing the top of his head into the man’s gut. With a whoof! theman
								staggered backward and tripped right at the edge of the fire.
							</p>

							<p>
								For a moment, nothing happened. Then the grain alcohol on his handsignited. He lifted
								his hand with a yell, and his hair ignited. His beardignited. His face. His yells
								pitched to tortured screams.
							</p>

							<p>
								Kip bolted, straight past the flaming man.No one moved for a blessed moment. Then
								someone dove for him,missing his body but clipping his heel. Kip went down heavily.
							</p>

							<p>
								He hadn’t even gotten three paces from the fire.Some run, Porky.He rolled over in time
								to see the flaming man, still screaming, runstraight into the fat woman. She shrieked,
								an oddly shrill sound to comefrom such a big woman, and started whacking at him with her
								big knife.
							</p>

							<p>
								Then three men were on Kip, the fire behind them making them hugegrotesque shadows. A
								kick caught Kip in the shoulder, then one from theother side hit his kidney. Pain lanced
								through him, taking his breath away.He curled into a ball.
							</p>

							<p>
								Kicks rained on his back and legs. One of the men was leaning overhim, punching his hip,
								his leg, trying to hit him in the crotch. Someonestomped on his head. It was a glancing
								blow, but it caught his nose. Hotblood exploded over his face and his head caromed off
								the dirt.
							</p>

							<p>
								Only a single thought won through the fog suddenly wreathing Kip’sbrain. They’re going
								to kill me. This wasn’t going to be punishment. It wasmurder.
							</p>

							<p>
								So be it. They’ll have to kill me on my feet. He struggled to all fours.That opened his
								ribs to attack and a kick hammered his side. Heabsorbed it with a groan.
							</p>

							<p>
								Three grown men, attacking a boy who’d done nothing to them.
							</p>

							<p>
								Something about the injustice of it tapped an iron reserve of will. No, notonly three
								now. More had joined. But the additional numbers onlyinfuriated Kip further. He hunched
								into his own bulk, gathering his strength,tucking his head between his shoulders. Burn
								in hell, I can take it.
							</p>

							<p>
								With an inhuman roar, a sound like Kip had never heard, a sound hedidn’t even know he
								was capable of, he shot to his feet, taking a widestance. The suddenness of his movement
								seemed amplified by his previousslowness.
							</p>

							<p>
								Bellowing, bleeding, with his yell he sprayed blood into the face of aman who’d been
								running forward to kick him. Kip was like a cave bear,suddenly standing on its hind
								legs. The man’s eyes went wide.
							</p>

							<p>
								Kip grabbed the man’s shirt and pulled, spinning, screaming, andhurling him the only
								direction that wasn’t blocked by bodies.
							</p>

							<p>
								Into the fire.The man saw where he was headed. He grabbed for the spit arcing overthe
								fire to catch himself, missed, caught it with his elbow instead. It spunhim sideways
								into the fire, his head dropping right into the heart of theflames, the spit collapsing.
							</p>

							<p>
								Kip didn’t watch, didn’t listen to the new screams. Someone hit him inthe stomach.
								Ordinarily the blow would have folded him in half. But nowthe pain didn’t matter. He
								found his attacker—a big, bearded man easily afoot taller than him, looking at him like
								he was stunned the boy hadn’tfallen. Kip grabbed the man’s beard and yanked it down
								toward him as hardas he could. At the same time, he lunged forward, head like a ram. The
								bigman’s face crunched as they collided. He went down in a spray of blood andflying
								teeth.
							</p>

							<p>
								Something like hope glimmered through Kip’s rage. He turned again,looking for another
								victim just as something cracked across his head.
							</p>

							<p>
								Kip went down. He wasn’t even aware of falling. He was just on theground, staring up at
								another grinning ghoul of a man carrying a piece offirewood in his hand. Behind that man
								were four others. Four? Still?Between the tears and the dizziness, Kip wasn’t even sure
								he was countingright.
							</p>

							<p>
								He clambered to all fours again, and promptly fell over, spots explodingin front of his
								eyes. He had no balance.“Throw him in the fire!” someone yelled.There were other words,
								but Kip couldn’t sort them out. The next thinghe knew, he was being lifted, one man
								taking each limb. He was facedown.The heat of the fire beat at the top of his head, his
								face.
							</p>

							<p>
								The men stopped. “Don’t push us in, you assholes!” one of the men atthe front said.“On
								three!”“Orholam, he’s big.”“Don’t have to throw him far.”“Gonna sizzle like bacon in the
								pan, ain’t he?”“One!”Kip swung a little over the fire, close enough that he swore his
								eyebrowscurled from the heat. Fear strangled him. The dizziness disappeared.
							</p>

							<p>
								He swung back away from the fire.“Two!”Enough. The odds were just too bad. I tried. What
								do I have to fearwhen I have nothing to lose? I despise myself. So what if I die? A
								littlepain, so what? Then the pain’s gone forever. Then oblivion.
							</p>

							<p>
								Kip swung farther over the fire, closing his eyes, welcoming the heat.
							</p>

							<p>
								His eyebrows and eyelashes melted. The fire licked his face like a cat.
							</p>

							<p>
								A Guile wouldn’t give up. They accepted you, Kip. Expected you to pullyour weight.
								Gavin, Ironfist, Liv, they let you belong for the first time inyour life. And you’re
								going to disappoint them?
							</p>

							<p>
								And like that, the fear was gone. No.They swung him back away from the fire; one last
								time. Four men. Four
							</p>

							<p>
								Ramirs. Four of his mother, treating him like shit and expecting him to takeit.
							</p>

							<p>
								Hell no. The sudden, implacable heat of Kip’s hatred matched the heatof the
								fire.“Three!”The men swung him forward.Kip kept his eyes open and felt them go wide—but
								not with fear, fearwas gone. His eyes widened at the sight of the fire like a lover’s
								eyes widenat the sight of his beloved. Yes, beautiful. Yes, mine.
							</p>

							<p>
								A rushing sound like a mighty wind roared out of nowhere. The firedeformed, leapt toward
								Kip—into Kip. And disappeared. The entire firewent out in an instant, plunging the camp
								into darkness.
							</p>

							<p>
								The men dropped Kip with a shout.And Kip barely noticed.He’d fallen among the embers. He
								caught himself with his left hand, andheard a sizzle as his hand closed around a burning
								faggot. Though he’dsucked up the whole fire, the embers were still red-hot.
							</p>

							<p>
								And Kip barely noticed. Rage was a sea and he merely floating in it. Hewasn’t himself,
								wasn’t aware of a self. There were only those he hated, whomust be struck down.
							</p>

							<p>
								He screamed, throwing a hand heavenward. Heat gushed out, becomingfire a foot away from
								his hand, painting the sky blue, yellow, orange, andred. He stood, heat roaring through
								his veins. Unbearable heat. Despite thedarkness, he could see the men who’d been holding
								him clearly. He sawtheir warmth. One had tripped and was staring at him, openmouthed.
							</p>

							<p>
								Kip flung a hand at him. Fire enveloped the man from head to foot.The others fled.Kip
								threw his left hand toward one. He felt skin crack as he opened thathand, but the pain
								was a distant echo. He aimed with his right hand, too.Pop, pop, pop. Three fireballs,
								each the size of his hand, flew into the night,almost pushing him back into the fire
								with the recoil. But each found itstarget, burying itself in a man’s back, gutting him
								with fire, cooking himfrom inside even as he fell.
							</p>

							<p>
								Falling to his knees, still hot, so hot, so overwhelmed, Kip raised hishands once more.
								Fire poured into the sky from both hands, even hiscrippled left hand. Then his vision
								returned to normal. He heaved deepbreaths, like some demon had just released him,
								leaving him empty, hollow,part of his humanity burnt away.
							</p>

							<p>
								The fire was burning once more, much smaller, the heat of the coalsslowly returning the
								wood to flame, illuminating the wagons and the facesof the fearful crowd gathering to
								see what had happened.
							</p>

							<p>
								In the light of the lanterns and torches and the reawakening fire, Kip sawthe scene with
								sane eyes. Scores of people were staring at him from a widecircle around the fire, all
								looking ready to bolt. There were bodies strewnabout: the four men who’d tried to throw
								him in the fire were dead, one acharred meaty skeleton, the others with holes the size
								of Kip’s hand in theirbacks.
							</p>

							<p>
								Somehow, the others were worse. The man Kip had doused with grainalcohol had skin
								sloughing off his face and chest and knife wounds all overhis arms and body. He lay
								moaning softly, a few tufts of hair still protrudingfrom his burnt scalp. The fat woman
								lay next to him, openly weeping. Theflaming man must have run headfirst into her,
								because her face wasscorched, blistered on the right side, her eyebrow gone, her hair
								meltedback halfway up her head, and somehow her own knife had been plunged tothe hilt
								low into her right side. Blood dribbled down her cheek. The manKip had flung into the
								fire was the worst, though. He’d caught the spit tostop himself, and only his head had
								dropped into the fire, falling directlyonto the hottest coals.
							</p>

							<p>
								He’d dragged himself out of the fire, and by some dark miracle he wasstill alive and
								still conscious. He was crying softly, as if even weeping hurt,but he couldn’t stop.
								He’d rolled over, exposing the burnt side of his head.His skin hadn’t just sloughed
								off—it had stuck to the coals like burntchicken sticking to a pan. His cheekbone was
								exposed, his cheek burnedthrough, exposing teeth now washed red with coursing blood as
								he wept,his eye burnt a chalky white.
							</p>

							<p>
								The only one who might survive was the bearded man whose teeth Kiphad smashed. He was
								unconscious, but so far as Kip could see, still alive.
							</p>

							<p>
								Kip tottered toward his horse, unfeeling. He didn’t have a plan. He justhad to get away.
								He was so ashamed. He got all the way to the beast beforehe saw the soldiers. They had
								surrounded the camp, but were staying backin the crowd. Kip looked at one of the
								soldiers who was mounted, anofficer, he guessed.“I’m sorry, sir, but we can’t let you
								leave,” the officer said. “One of the
							</p>

							<p>
								Free will be along for you shortly.”“They attacked me,” Kip said, exhausted. “Tried to
								rob me. I… I didn’tmean…” He leaned against the horse. Stupid beast hadn’t run away. Oh,
								itdidn’t have a line of sight, and it had been tied up so it couldn’t leave if itwanted
								to. Still, he would have expected it to be going crazy. Instead, itstood, placid as
								ever. Kip leaned against it.
							</p>

							<p>
								With his left hand. Orholam. The skin cracked and tore open and startedbleeding at every
								joint. Kip gave a little cry. But even the thought of hisown agony dragged his eyes back
								to the fire, to the people he’d killed, andthose who weren’t dead yet but would be. His
								heart felt wooden, like heshould feel more, but he just couldn’t.
							</p>

							<p>
								Looking back, though, he saw a young man moving among the bodies,checking them. The
								young man—no, boy, for he couldn’t have been morethan sixteen despite his splendid
								clothing—was pulling white fawnskingloves off his hands. Large hooked nose, light brown
								skin, dark eyes, darkunruly hair. Over his white shirt, his forearms were covered
								withmulticolored vambraces with five thick bands of color against a whitebackground. His
								cloak echoed the pattern, from a band outlined in blackthat looked fuzzy—sub-red?—to red
								to orange to yellow to green. Therewas no blue or superviolet. It didn’t take a genius
								to guess he was apolychrome.
							</p>

							<p>
								But that wasn’t what arrested Kip’s attention. Out of all the thousands ofpeople in this
								camp, and out of the hundreds of drafters they must have, Kiprecognized this one. He’d
								been part of the force that massacred Rekton.He’d personally tried to kill Kip at the
								water market. Zymun, the boy’smaster had called him. Kip’s heart plummeted like a child
								jumping off awaterfall.
							</p>

							<p>
								Zymun put on a pair of green spectacles. “Hello, firefriend,” he said.“Welcome to our
								war. I assume you’ve come to join the Free?”“Right,” Kip said, finding his voice. The
								Free?Emerald smoke swirled down into Zymun’s hands. “Just so you know,”he said, “you can
								kill who you must—though Lord Omnichrome prefers itnot be so indiscriminate—but when you
								do, please clean up your messes.”He swept his arms in a martial circle, slowly, bending
								his knees, giving theimpression of gathering energy. Then his hands snapped across each
								other,flashed out. Pa-pop, pa-pop. Four spikes of green luxin, each as long as afinger,
								shot out in two volleys. Around the fire, almost simultaneously, fourheads burst open
								with wet splatters. The wounded. Their moans stoppedinstantly.
							</p>

							<p>
								Kip goggled.Zymun looked pleased with himself. He folded his green spectacles andtucked
								them in a pocket.
							</p>

							<p>
								He’s showing off. He’s showing off by killing people.Zymun frowned suddenly as Kip
								stepped close. “What’s your name?”“Kip,” Kip said, before thinking that it might be a
								poor choice to use hisreal name.“Kip, you have a tooth in your head.”Huh? Kip showed his
								teeth and pointed. “Actually, I have all my teeth inmy head.” Play it like you don’t
								want to throw up, Kip. Push through this.“No, not your tooth,” Zymun said. He gestured
								to his own scalp like hewas being a mirror.
							</p>

							<p>
								Kip reached up and, sure enough, there was a tooth sticking in his scalp.
							</p>

							<p>
								What the hell? He pulled it out, wincing, and fresh blood dribbled down hisface.“Hmm,”
								Zymun said. “Maybe we’ll take you by the chirurgeons firstand get you looked
								at.”“First?” Kip asked.“Yes, of course. Lord Omnichrome insists on meeting all of our
								drafters.
							</p>

							<p>
								Even the sloppy ones.”

								Chapter 71
							</p>

							<p>
								As darkness fell over the vast host, Liv wandered through campsites,becoming more and
								more aware that she was alone and female, surroundedby rough men. Lots of rough men. Men
								who were laughing too loud,drinking too much, afraid of the coming battle. And if being
								Tyrean hadmade her an outcast and studiously ignored back at the Chromeria, here shehad
								no such protection. Most of the men looked at her subtly enough that ifshe hadn’t been
								so intensely aware of being alone and not wanting to belooked at, she would never have
								noticed it. Others stared at her so blatantlythat she checked her neckline. Nope, it was
								quite modest.
							</p>

							<p>
								Just a few jackasses who’ve been away from their wives for too long.She was practically
								starving, and though she didn’t want to stop at anycampfire, it was the only way to get
								not only food, but information.
							</p>

							<p>
								Liv picked a campfire with some kind-looking farmers huddled around apot of stew. She
								couldn’t see everyone before she entered the circle, ofcourse, but a few of them looked
								kind, and it was the best she could do.“Good evening,” she said, a little more cheerily
								than she felt. “I’d givehalf a danar for some stew. You have any extra?”
							</p>

							<p>
								Eight heads swiveled toward her. An older man spoke. “It’s a mite thinto call it a stew.
								One rabbit, a couple tubers, and the leavings of a javelinaleg between nine mouths.” He
								smiled, self-effacing. “But Mori did find agrapefruit tree the soldiers missed somehow.”
							</p>

							<p>
								Feeling reassured, Liv came closer. The man looked at her eyes, blinked,and said, “If
								you’re getting hassled, you should put on your spectacles,young lady.”“Hassled? Why
								would you think that?” Liv asked. “And it’s Liv, thankyou.”“You look as skittish as a
								deer at a watering hole, that’s why.” Hehanded her a tin cup of broth with a few chunks.
								He waved off her attemptto pay him. She ate the thin stew and the small, underripe
								grapefruit theygave her, and mostly sat and watched.
							</p>

							<p>
								After a time, the men returned to their talk of war and weather and cropsthey hadn’t
								bothered to plant this year, citrus trees they hadn’t bothered toprune because if they
								bore more fruit, it only meant the bandits wouldspend longer close to their village.
								They weren’t bad men. In fact, theyseemed quite decent. They had their complaints about
								King Garadul, andone muttered darkly about a “Lord Omnichrome” before remembering thata
								drafter was present, but they reserved their hatred for their occupiers.
							</p>

							<p>
								The nuances of the rotating rule of Garriston were lost on them. Theydidn’t
								differentiate between the better and worse occupiers. They hatedthem all. One had lost
								his daughter a number of years before when a patrolhad passed through their village and
								an officer had simply taken her. He’dgone to Garriston afterward to try to find her, but
								never did. The others hadcome partly for their friend, partly because they had nothing
								else to do andtaking a city might drop a few coins into their hands, and partly
								becausethey hated the outlanders.
							</p>

							<p>
								And so men will die and kill for an offense ten years old, committed bysome other
								country.
							</p>

							<p>
								There was no point reasoning with them, even if Liv had cared to. Foolswho could be our
								friends at some other time, her father had said. After shefinished eating, she put on
								her yellow spectacles, drafted a few luxintorches that would last for a few days to
								thank them for the soup and thefruit, asked directions to where the drafters were
								camped, and then headedout.
							</p>

							<p>
								No one bothered her on her way. Once a man called out to her as shepassed, but the
								comment dried up on his lips as he saw her coloredspectacles—even now, in the darkness,
								they respected drafters.
							</p>

							<p>
								The drafters’ tents were separate from everyone else’s—not becausethey were guarded or
								staked off, but evidently no one wanted to camp tooclose to them. Liv slipped her
								spectacles off, but kept them in hand, in casesomeone challenged her.
							</p>

							<p>
								She moved past a wagon surrounded by Mirrormen and painted allviolet—odd, but she didn’t
								slow, she moved with purpose, as if she hadorders. It was a trick she’d learned in the
								Chromeria. If you stood around,some full drafter would find something for you to do. If
								you looked busy,you could get away with almost anything.
							</p>

							<p>
								She passed a number of fires with drafters being served a lavish dinnerby cooks and wine
								or ales by a large number of slaves. The drafters all woretheir colors on their wrists
								in either cloth or metal vambraces or in largebracelets for some of the women. The hem
								of their cloaks or dresses alsoechoed the color. Other than that, everyone wore his own
								style. In general,though, these drafters were much more interested in loudly
								proclaimingtheir colors in broad swathes across their clothes than was common at
								theChromeria, where a woman might have a single green hairpin to let othersknow she was
								a green.
							</p>

							<p>
								They were a raucous, privileged group, but as Liv watched from theshadows, she saw that
								the men and women here often glanced to the south—not to the huge pavilion guarded by
								drafters and Mirrormen alike that Livassumed was King Garadul’s residence, but to
								another set of bonfires. Shegrabbed a pitcher of wine from one of the slaves’ tables and
								headed over. Inthe dark, her own apparel didn’t look too different from the slaves’.
							</p>

							<p>
								What she saw, beyond the forms of the slaves, took her breath away.
							</p>

							<p>
								People—or monsters shaped like people—were talking, drinking, cavorting,drafting.
							</p>

							<p>
								Nearest to Liv, a circle of blue drafters, half of them wearing bluespectacles, and all
								filled with blue luxin, tinting their skin in the firelight,were talking with a woman
								who seemed made of crystal.
							</p>

							<p>
								For long moments, Liv had no idea what she was seeing. They weredrafters, though,
								obviously, and there was luxin everywhere. Oathbreakers.The mad. The broken. Color
								wights. Liv could barely take it in.
							</p>

							<p>
								These were people who’d violated everything Liv had been taught. Shecaught only
								fractured details. A broken-haloed eye. The crystalline womandrafting a matrix in the
								air as the other blues listened. Greens laughing,dancing around one fire, bouncing on
								unnaturally springy legs, jumpinghigher than any man Liv had ever seen, doing flips and
								backflips over eachother. A man and a woman, skin permanently green but not yet
								transformed,were standing, holding each other, grinding their hips together, dancing in
								amanner so lascivious that—wait, no, the woman’s skirt was bunched aroundher waist. In
								full view of everyone, including some cheering drafters, theywere actually—
							</p>

							<p>
								Liv tore her eyes away, her cheeks suddenly hot. A yellow was tossinglittle luxin balls
								into the air while a blue shot blue bullets at them, each littletarget exploding in a
								flash of light when he connected.
							</p>

							<p>
								But Liv’s eyes were drawn to the full color wights. Even here, thereweren’t many. She’d
								only heard rumors about such things at the Chromeria.They said almost everyone who broke
								their halo simply went mad and died—or went mad and killed others, more often. That
								danger was what madethe Pact necessary. Orholam made magic to serve men, and a drafter
								sworeto serve her community. Oathbreakers served only themselves, and theyendangered
								everyone.
							</p>

							<p>
								But there were always the legends of those who remade themselves.
							</p>

							<p>
								Now, here, Liv was seeing that they weren’t wild tales. Now, here, thesedrafters were
								teaching each other how to do it. Liv looked at the crystal bluewoman. She was oddly
								beautiful. Crystal hair, and diamond-shaped eyecaps close over her eyes, flawed crystal
								skin, broken into a thousand facets,covering every natural curve of her body. She’d
								conquered the problem ofhow to deal with drafting hard, unbending blue luxin onto a body
								that hadto be able to move and to bend by making thousands—tens of thousands—of small
								crystals. Her body glimmered, shimmered, coruscated in thefirelight as she shifted her
								upper body like a dancer to show her discipleswhat she’d done. She laughed, showing
								strangely white teeth against thosegleaming blue lips. Then she shifted suddenly into a
								fighting stance, spikyguards springing up along the edges of her forearms, and plates of
								blueluxin congealing over her skin to make armor.
							</p>

							<p>
								Shit!“Hey, caleen! I said wine!” a voice said.Liv turned and found herself face-to-face
								with a man with hideous burnscars all over his body. A sub-red, with the odd shimmering
								of fire crystalbroken through his halos. He held out a glass to Liv, and she filled it
								withwine, trembling, averting her own eyes until he looked away. The man helda haze pipe
								in one hand, and there were fresh burns all along his skin. AsLiv looked, she realized
								the burns were deliberate. He was trying to scar allof his skin deeply enough to lose
								feeling in it. Until then, he was deadeninghimself to the pain any way he could.
							</p>

							<p>
								It had to be incredibly dangerous to even be in close proximity to a madfire drafter. He
								couldn’t control himself normally, and now he was drunkand high on haze.
							</p>

							<p>
								The man had barely left when Liv saw a gout of flame blast into thenight sky a few
								hundred yards away. She stopped, and so did a few of thecolor wights, nudging those
								around them and pointing.
							</p>

							<p>
								Whatever it had been, the drafter who’d done it had been powerful. Thatwas a lot of fire
								to throw into the night. Where had he gotten the light to dothat? From one of the
								bonfires?
							</p>

							<p>
								Then it happened again, fire painting the sky for several seconds. Livfelt her throat
								tighten with fear. Kip! No, that was ridiculous. Kip wasgreen/blue. Fire, sub-red, was
								at the opposite end of the spectrum. Itcouldn’t be Kip. The color wights just laughed,
								as if it were one of theirown out there, having fun.
							</p>

							<p>
								Orholam, Kip could be getting killed out there in the night. Liv neededto go.
							</p>

							<p>
								She turned and headed out of camp. She almost ran into a dozen
							</p>

							<p>
								Mirrormen who were escorting a woman clad in a gorgeous black dress andwearing violet
								eye caps out of the king’s pavilion. Liv stopped. Karris.
							</p>

							<p>
								They hustled past, but Liv had no doubt where they were going. Karriswas being held in
								that odd violet wagon she’d seen, held captive. Livshould have figured it out earlier.
							</p>

							<p>
								Still, any elation Liv had felt about finding Karris—actually finding her,on the first
								day, in a camp of maybe a hundred thousand souls if not more—was quashed by her fear for
								Kip.
							</p>

							<p>
								When she got out of the drafters’ area, she put on her yellow spectacles.
							</p>

							<p>
								No one bothered her. She arrived at the place she and Kip had agreed tomeet just in
								time, but he wasn’t there. He never came.
							</p>

							<p>
								The next day, she learned a heavy boy with Tyrean skin and blue eyeshad been attacked
								and had killed five men—or ten or twenty, or five womentoo, depending on the rumor—and
								then thrown fire into the air. He’d beentaken away by drafters and Mirrormen. Despite
								the impossibilities—Kipcouldn’t draft sub-red—her intuition confirmed it. It had been
								Kip. She wassure. Someone had drafted fire, someone else had killed those people, andKip
								had been taken.
							</p>

							<p>
								She searched for him for two days. She found nothing.
							</p>

							<p>
								Chapter 72
							</p>

							<p>
								As the sun dragged its feet toward the horizon, Gavin gave the signal, andthe teamsters’
								whips cracked. The draft horses surged forward. Their leadsdrew taut, and the ropes
								connected to the great yellow luxin supportsstrained for a moment. Then the supports
								fell, the great straining mass ofthe horses snatching them away from the dropping wall.
							</p>

							<p>
								The final layer of yellow luxin hit the ground with a boom, shaking theearth. Gavin
								quickly moved to inspect that everything had gone accordingto plan.“One league out!”
								Corvan called. He was standing on top of the wall,looking out toward King Garadul’s vast
								army.“Shit!”“Here, Lord Prism!” one of the engineers called.Gavin hurried over. The last
								of many big problems he’d run into incrafting a wall almost entirely of yellow luxin was
								that all the luxin had tobe sealed. The seal was always the weakest point. If you could
								melt throughthat one area—no mean feat, but still—the whole structure would unravel.That
								his wall was made in sections just meant that each section had multipleseals. If any
								section failed, it would be catastrophic—an entire section ofwall, fifty paces across,
								would splash into liquid light in moments.
							</p>

							<p>
								It was probably the reason no one before Gavin had been idiot enough tomake an entire
								wall of yellow luxin.
							</p>

							<p>
								The solution had been simplicity itself: two layers of luxin, eachprotecting the other,
								the seals to the inside. That part was common enoughamong drafters, but the seal was
								always the last thing you touched. So youcouldn’t really tuck it inside, not on
								something as big as a wall. You couldprotect one seal by covering it with more luxin and
								sealing that, but one sealwould always be external. Most drafters would have covered the
								seal andcovered that seal and covered that one and left it at that.
							</p>

							<p>
								It wasn’t good enough for Gavin. He’d built the entire second layer ofthe wall up on
								supports. Then he’d built each side, sealing them on theinside. When the draft horses
								pulled out the supports and the second layerof wall fell into place, it left a structure
								where the seals—for the first timethat Gavin had ever heard of—were truly protected, not
								just by yellowluxin, but by the vast weight of the wall itself. And as each section
								lockedto the next, it became more and more difficult for anyone to ever lift thewall to
								access the seals.
							</p>

							<p>
								Gavin was building something monumental, something pure, and it feltgreat. This edifice
								would stand long after he was dead. There weren’t manymen who could claim the same. The
								locals were already calling itBrightwater Wall.
							</p>

							<p>
								Hurrying over to the engineer who’d called out, Gavin found that one ofthe supports
								hadn’t been pulled all the way free. The wall had dropped on it,pounding the
								two-pace-wide support almost halfway into the earth, andkeeping the wall from fitting
								the next section perfectly.“Three minutes until our artillery will be in place!” Corvan
								called down.Sonuvabitch! Gavin dropped on his knees next to the broad yellowsupport and
								brushed dirt away hurriedly. The support, unlike the wallsections, was sealed right at
								the surface for just this eventuality. Right…there! Gavin sent some sub-red into the
								seal and the entire supportdissolved, the yellow luxin abruptly liquid. The wall settled
								with a deeprumble.
							</p>

							<p>
								Gavin had made the tolerances too tight. He should have made thosejoints able to hook
								together even if they weren’t so well aligned. The tightjoints gave the wall more
								strength and would keep soldiers inside dry evenduring rainstorms, but still.
							</p>

							<p>
								Taking his attention off the wall for the first time in hours—it felt likedays, though
								it was only early evening—he looked to the people assembled,looking for who he needed.
							</p>

							<p>
								There were thousands assembled. Most of the people of Garristonwanted to see the wall
								being built. Vendors had set up their wagons andstalls. Minstrels wandered through,
								playing and prodding people for coins.Soldiers kept avenues clear and began ferrying
								gear and powder and ropesand shot for cannons and firewood for furnaces and additional
								armor andarrows and muskets. Others operated the cranes as soon as the second
								layersettled in place. Drafters were pouring through the inside of the wall,sealing any
								cracks, looking for flaws that they could fix, or larger ones thatneeded Gavin’s hand.
								The Blackguards—nearly a hundred of them—alsostood nearby.
							</p>

							<p>
								They’d told everyone to leave already, but they didn’t have the men tospare to enforce
								the order. The people were too curious; they knew they’dnever see anything like this
								again in their lives. Gavin couldn’t worry aboutthem right now. He was already feeling
								the tightness of impossibilitysqueezing his chest.“Captain!” Gavin called. “You’ve seen
								the process. Get the teamstersmoving as fast as they can. We’ve got sixteen more
								sections. Send half theteams all the way to the east side, and have half work from here
								out. Takesix drafters. You four, you, and you. You’ve seen what I’ve done. Go do
								it.“General Danavis, talk to me!” Gavin shouted. Less than a league now.
							</p>

							<p>
								It should be enough.
							</p>

							<p>
								Gavin moved to the inside of the great arch that would hold the gate.
							</p>

							<p>
								There were open holes, tubes running down the great curving length of thewall. Gavin
								filled himself with light and blasted green luxin down eachtube. It would give the wall
								some flex, but also strength to recoil from anybattering ram blow. He sealed each green
								luxin tube at the end.“Lord Prism,” Corvan called, holding a fresh-drafted telescope up
								to oneeye. “It looks like they have teams pushing their artillery out in front of
								thearmy. They know we don’t have the skirmishers to go out and smash them.Damn spies! I
								can’t see the culverins, but we know they have half a dozen.If they fire from greatest
								random—” He paused, doing mental calculations.Greatest random was literally the greatest
								distance gunners could reach, butat almost two thousand paces for the biggest culverins,
								there was no suchthing as aiming. “They could begin their bombardment anytime now if
								theircrews are practiced. Within minutes, even if they’re not.”
							</p>

							<p>
								It wasn’t the culverins Gavin was worried about. Because of thetrajectory of those big
								guns, their shots would hit the front of the wall.Brightwater Wall could take as many
								direct hits as they wanted to give it.They would have to come substantially closer for
								the higher-trajectoryhowitzers and closer still for the mortars that would absolutely
								wreak havocon the stubborn crowds behind the wall. Garriston’s cannons would have
								toknock out those guns before they could be placed, bagged, and loaded.“Damn it, find
								someone who’s not doing something more important andget these damn people back,” Gavin
								ordered. “This isn’t a Sun Day outing!Shells are going to be landing where they sit in
								ten minutes!” Gavin turnedback to General Danavis. “Start firing as soon as you can. Buy
								me time,General!”
							</p>

							<p>
								Gavin felt more than heard the next section of wall fall into place.
							</p>

							<p>
								People were rushing everywhere, but he pushed it out of his mind andconfronted the new
								biggest problem of all, now that the wall was actuallytaking shape.
							</p>

							<p>
								He hadn’t built the gate.He ran over to one of the cranes hoisting supplies to the top
								of the wall.
							</p>

							<p>
								It was already lifting off the ground as he approached, rising fast. Gavinjumped,
								throwing out two hooks of blue and green luxin, snagging the sidesof the load. He rose
								fast and pulled himself up. He jumped off as soon asthe load settled on top of the wall,
								startling the soldiers operating the crane.They froze.“To work!” he roared. They jumped,
								and then jumped to it.Gavin ran across the top of the wall, dodging men to get back to
								the archabove the gap where he needed to draft the gate.
							</p>

							<p>
								Tremblefist was barking orders, sending up a small number of
							</p>

							<p>
								Blackguards to stand with Gavin—as if they could do anything to protecthim from incoming
								shells—but not so many that they would get in the wayof the defenders trying to set up
								the wall for any of a hundred tasks. Therest of the Blackguards took up positions in
								front of the empty gate.
							</p>

							<p>
								As in all battles, there was simply too much to see, too much happeningall at the same
								time to put everything together. Gavin looked toward thesun, poised above the horizon.
							</p>

							<p>
								Two hours. All I need is two hours. Protecting these people is one greatpurpose I have
								that you must approve of. So if you’re up there, would youplease get off your holy ass
								and help me?
							</p>

							<p>
								General Danavis had been organizing, training, promoting, firing, andtraining
								Garriston’s defenders for the past week. Twenty hours a day,sometimes twenty-two. It was
								inhuman, and yet it wasn’t enough. Gavinwas accustomed to the discipline and ease of
								working with veterans. By theend of the Prisms’ War, his men had worked together
								fluidly. Stocking thiswall with supplies would have taken his veterans literally
								one-third of thetime it was taking these men. His veteran cannoneers would already
								besighted in, with distances marked off. These men barely knew each other,much less
								trusted each other. It made everything painfully slow, and Gavinwas slow to adjust to
								how slow they were.
							</p>

							<p>
								We’re doomed.But then he drafted a quick platform to walk out on in front of the
								openarch—necessary to gather some of his open threads of luxin—and he caughthis first
								sight of the wall as his enemies would see it.
							</p>

							<p>
								That damned boy artist had made his masterpiece.Gavin had been the one who filled the
								forms, but he’d always beenhovering above them, and while he was getting the sections to
								fit togetherhe’d always been on the other side of the wall. Now he saw the whole.
							</p>

							<p>
								The entire wall—the entire great curving league of it—glowed the colorof the sun when it
								first shows its face. That glow came from the liquidyellow—a hair’s breadth from being
								perfect, hard yellow—that floatedbehind the first layer of perfect yellow. The liquid
								yellow would mend anydamage that did scar the outer wall. But then, within that thin
								layer, Gavinsaw that his old drafters, doubtless under the direction of Aheyyad,
								hadadded their own touches. As an enemy approached, he would see that theentire wall was
								swarming with loathsome things. Spiders the size of a man’shead appeared to be crawling
								across the wall, stopping, little jaws clacking.Small dragons appeared to swoop and
								spin. Disapproving faces swirled upout of the gloom. A woman ran from some many-fanged
								thing and was tornto pieces and devoured alive, her face painted with despair. A man
								whoappeared to be walking along the base of the wall was seized by hands thatswirled out
								of the mist and yanked him in. Beautiful women turned intomonsters with forked tongues
								and huge claws. Blood seeped and pooled onthe ground. And those were just the things
								Gavin could see in a cursoryglance. It was as if the drafters had gotten together and
								taken everynightmare any of them had ever had and put it into the wall. They
								wereillusions, all of them mere images within the wall, but an enemy wouldn’tknow that
								at first, and even if they did know it, it was scary as the evernightitself. Better, it
								would certainly distract enemy archers and musketeers frommaking accurate shots at the
								murder holes hidden by those images.
							</p>

							<p>
								And that was just the wide blank sections of the wall. At every corbel,the scowling,
								forbidding figure of a Prism looked down on the attackers. As
							</p>

							<p>
								Gavin looked, he saw that every Prism for the past four hundred years hadbeen crafted
								into the wall, with Lucidonius at the right hand of the figurewho dominated all and
								Gavin himself at the left hand. Above them, over thehuge gate gap, loomed the scowling
								figure of Orholam himself, radiant andfurious, his planted arms making the arches of the
								gate. Anyone attackingthis gate would be attacking Orholam himself, and all his Prisms.
								A brilliantlittle trick to make the attackers feel uneasy. Each figure,
								includingOrholam, had cunningly hidden machicolations to drop stones or fire ormagic on
								attackers.
							</p>

							<p>
								Gavin bit off another curse. He’d paused for a good five seconds,admiring his own damned
								wall. He didn’t have time.
							</p>

							<p>
								For a moment, he thought of simply closing the gate gap, just makingpure wall. But at
								this point, that wouldn’t be any faster. The forms werealready shaped to make a gate.
								All he had to do was fill them and tie them—just on one side, the cleverness he’d use
								for the rest of the wall wouldhave to wait. Tomorrow, if they lived that long.
							</p>

							<p>
								Gavin gathered the spools of superviolet that connected the wholesuperstructure of the
								wall and began pouring in yellow luxin.
							</p>

							<p>
								Orholam, he was exhausted. He’d been drafting to his absolute limitevery day for the
								last five days, and all through this day in particular sincethe first rays of dawn. If
								he’d been a normal drafter, he’d have gone madlong ago. Even most Prisms would have
								killed themselves with the amountof drafting Gavin had done. The others knew it too. If
								anything, Gavin hadgotten more powerful since the war, and far more efficient. He’d
								seenwomen like Tala—whom he’d never seen impressed by anything in her life—shoot glances
								his way during unguarded moments like he was downrightfrightening. But there was only so
								much even he could draft.
							</p>

							<p>
								Nonetheless, he poured perfect yellow luxin into the forms. The real
							</p>

							<p>
								Gavin couldn’t have done this: he wasn’t a superchromat, he couldn’t drafta perfect
								yellow. But Gavin couldn’t go halfway. There was no “goodenough” with yellow luxin; if
								it weren’t drafted perfectly, it would dissolve.Simple as that.
							</p>

							<p>
								Something rocked the wall, and Gavin almost fell from his perch.
							</p>

							<p>
								Someone steadied him, and he saw that Tremblefist was standing besidehim, holding him
								up. A moment later, he heard the delayed rumble ofdistant artillery.“I’ve got you,”
								Tremblefist said. He wasn’t quite as big as his olderbrother, but he too had worked with
								Gavin a long time. He must have seenthe glazed, stupefied look in Gavin’s eyes, because
								he said, “Our owncannons will start in a moment. Don’t be… distracted.” Don’t be
								alarmed,he meant. Don’t be frightened. Don’t botch the gate and get us all killed.
							</p>

							<p>
								More of King Garadul’s artillery began landing in the field, most of itfar short of
								Brightwater Wall. The sound of the enemy culverins became athunderstorm in the distance.
								Gavin gathered his will and kept drafting. Hedidn’t realize that he was weaving on his
								feet until he felt Tremblefist’s bighands close on his shoulders. Several other
								Blackguards pressed close.“Raise the cowl!” General Danavis yelled.As yellow luxin
								splashed from Gavin’s hands into the forms below him,he felt the wall shudder as each
								section of the cowl swung into place oncounterweights. The cowl was his architect’s
								invention. Basically, it was aremovable roof for use during artillery bombardment. There
								were plenty oftimes when an open roof was preferable—to gather rainwater, when it
								wasunbearably hot, or when men had to carry great loads or carts had to passdown the
								length of the wall. But during a bombardment, it would shielddefenders from howitzers
								and mortar fire. The wall’s own artillery was leftfree to fire on the same basic
								defensive design as an arrow slit—easy to fireout at a wide angle, but requiring a
								direct hit from the other side to put it outof commission.“What the hell is that?”
								Tremblefist breathed. Gavin wouldn’t have evenheard him except that the man was
								basically holding him up. AndTremblefist didn’t talk to himself much.
							</p>

							<p>
								Gavin looked up, giving himself a small break, and looked over theplain.
							</p>

							<p>
								The army was rumbling ever closer, catching up with their culverins. Infront of them
								were teams setting up the howitzers—the defenders stillhadn’t fired a single shot, a
								fact that had General Danavis screaming at thenearest crews.
							</p>

							<p>
								But that wasn’t what had Tremblefist cursing. In front of the main army,drawing even
								with the advance cannon emplacements, were more than ahundred men and women, some
								riding, and some simply running. All weredressed in brightly colored clothing. Gavin
								could tell that by the way thegreens moved, sprinting with huge bouncing,
								league-devouring strides thatthey weren’t just drafters. They were color wights, and
								they were headedstraight for the gate.
							</p>

							<p>
								They would be at the wall within four minutes at the most.Four minutes. Gavin looked at
								his half-formed gate. If he didn’t worryabout hinges, if he just sealed the damn thing
								to the wall itself, it waspossible. Maybe. He looked up at the sun, gathering power. It
								was less thanan hour until sunset. The festivities for Sun Day’s Eve would start as
								soonas the last ray of sun disappeared from the horizon. Whether the attackerswere
								heretics or pagans or faithful, they wouldn’t fight during Sun Day. SunDay was holy even
								to the gods Lucidonius had driven out.
							</p>

							<p>
								If they could hold off the attackers for that one hour, they had a chance.
							</p>

							<p>
								And Sun Day would give them the time they needed to reinforce the gatesand get supplies
								and guns in place.
							</p>

							<p>
								One day. One hour. Four minutes that would determine the course of thiswar. It came down
								to this. Gavin was not going to quit. He had four minutesleft in him.
							</p>

							<p>
								The culverins on the wall finally answered those out in the field, but theshots were
								wild, not even close to the field artillery emplacements or thecharging color wights.
								And more of King Garadul’s shots were hitting thewall itself, each rebounding off the
								yellow luxin with a crunch and a whineand a splay of yellow light as the wall absorbed
								the blow and healed itself.
							</p>

							<p>
								The forms Gavin was filling with luxin were three-quarters full, washinghim in the
								invigorating scents so close to mint and eucalyptus, but he wastiring anyway. He looked
								out to the color wights. Not even two minutes left.
							</p>

							<p>
								Orholam, I’m trying to do something good here. Great purpose,
							</p>

							<p>
								Orholam. Selfless and all that. You want people to be selfless, right?
							</p>

							<p>
								Tremblefist handed Gavin off and was shouting orders down to the
							</p>

							<p>
								Blackguards on the ground. General Danavis was ordering troops to thegate and to form in
								ranks behind the wall. The crowd was beginning toscatter. Everyone was shouting, but
								Gavin couldn’t even make out thewords anymore.
							</p>

							<p>
								Flashes of magic bloomed in front of him. The color wights had spottedhim. They were
								throwing missiles and fire and everything they could thinkof, but his Blackguards were
								deflecting it all.
							</p>

							<p>
								Gavin kept drafting. The color wights were only two hundred paces outnow, running at a
								full sprint. He had only seconds left. A cannon roared toGavin’s right and tore through
								a dozen of the color wights, shredding them.
							</p>

							<p>
								But the color wights behind them leapt through the blood and smoke andflying limbs,
								faces snarling, inhuman, glowing.
							</p>

							<p>
								Drafting the last of the yellow luxin to fill the last form, Gavin pulledthe threads
								together in his hand. He was going to make it! He was sealingthe luxin when a cannonball
								smashed into the forms. All the force of theimpossibly lucky shot went straight into
								Gavin’s hands. It was like holdinga rope and having someone drop an anvil tied to the
								other side.
							</p>

							<p>
								The luxin was yanked out of Gavin’s hands instantaneously. Gate andcannonball slammed
								into the ground beneath the arch, the cannonballblasting through Blackguards and a dozen
								still-gawking civilians behindthem. The gate—abruptly unheld, unsealed yellow
								luxin—hissed andseethed into light before Gavin could stop it.
							</p>

							<p>
								In two seconds, the gate flashboiled into nothingness and disappeared—and so did
								Garriston’s hope.
							</p>

							<p>
								Chapter 73
							</p>

							<p>
								Gavin collapsed. Or he would have, if two Blackguards hadn’t caught himand dragged him
								away from the brink. He wanted to fight them, to stand up,but he was so lightheaded he
								couldn’t even make words.
							</p>

							<p>
								He missed the first clash, right below his perch, but he heard it, felt it.
							</p>

							<p>
								The yells of men and women bracing themselves, giving voice to fear andrage, honing
								their will for their drafting. Then waves of heat and the shockof impact, armor popping,
								men and wights grunting. Then, screams, alwaysscreams.“Where are my muskets?! I ordered
								those brought here two hours ago!”
							</p>

							<p>
								General Danavis was screaming. Swearing. He was standing ten paces fromGavin, looking
								through the murder holes and machicolations at the battlebeneath the arch of the gate.
								His soldiers were blinking at him. Out oftwenty men, only two had muskets. “Fire, damn
								you!” he shouted at them.“You, and you, go find muskets. Now!” Then he was gone,
								screaming at theartillery crews.
							</p>

							<p>
								The Blackguards pulled Gavin to the edge of the wall. The cowl on thewall meant there
								were only a few places open on either the front or theback. They found one where the
								cranes pulled in goods. A Blackguardbichrome drafted a blue-green slide all the way to
								the ground.“What are you doing?” Gavin managed.“We’re taking you to safety, sir.” Then
								the man jumped onto the slide.Gavin was looking through the bright hallway formed by the
								bonnet toone of the culverin teams. They had fired a ball and were looking downfield—the
								sign of an inexperienced crew. Only one man needed to watch so theycould adjust their
								aim. The rest should be reloading already. But after amoment, they cheered. “Got it!”
								Gavin couldn’t see what they’d hit, but asthey turned back to their task, he saw a flash
								of movement.“It’s safe!” the Blackguard called up from the ground at the base of
							</p>

							<p>
								Brightwater Wall.
							</p>

							<p>
								Green claws latched onto the wall just in front of the artillery team.
							</p>

							<p>
								What? Gavin had known green wights to infuse their legs with thespringiness of green
								luxin, but he’d never seen one jump even half theheight of this wall. He cried out,
								pointing, but not before the beast flungitself upon the artillerymen. Its hands, grown
								into huge claws, tore throughfour men before they even knew it was there. Blood was
								flung in broadarcs, splattering against the walls. The last three men saw the beast,
								butfroze. Only one even made an attempt to grab a musket from the wall.
							</p>

							<p>
								The green wight clove the man’s head in three, two broad clawsdescending halfway through
								his head.
							</p>

							<p>
								The Blackguards hesitated for only half a second. None of them hadever seen a color
								wight either. Four Blackguards stepped forward, almostsimultaneously. The two in front
								went to one knee, clearing firing lanesover their heads. Their hands dipped in unison,
								one hand coming up todraft, the other coming up with a pistol.
							</p>

							<p>
								Triggers clicked, and flints struck, but in the two seconds it took to fire apistol,
								luxin was already streaking out from every drafter. A ball of blueluxin like a fist
								hammered the green wight toward a wall. A glob of redluxin splattered across its side
								and back and made it stick to the wall. Slickorange smeared the floor in case it pulled
								away. But that wasn’t necessary.The green wight’s claws were still stuck in the
								unfortunate gunner’s head,and it had no time to react before the last Blackguard’s
								flames hit the redluxin and set it alight.
							</p>

							<p>
								The next moment, three guns roared. All three hit the green wight’schest. Green luxin
								and all too human red blood burst from the wounds. Thewight would have collapsed, but
								the red luxin held it to the wall, even as itburned.“Black out!” One of the Blackguards
								yelled. She stepped forward,already pouring more powder in her flashpan. Apparently hers
								had been thegun that misfired. She cocked the gun, aimed, and pulled the trigger.
								Asecond later, it blew the still-burning green wight’s head apart.
							</p>

							<p>
								The Blackguards were already reloading their pistols. For most of them,
							</p>

							<p>
								Gavin knew, it was their very first battle. First blood. Yet each reloaded hisor her
								pistol without looking. It was something they were taught to do onlywhen there was
								extreme and pressing danger—visually inspecting a pistolwas usually a good idea to
								prevent misfires and double-charging—but itwas worth it to not have to take your eyes
								off the battlefield sometimes, andall of them had the presence of mind to do it
								correctly.“Tell General Danavis to withdraw the cowl,” Gavin said. The cowl waskeeping
								the green wights from getting in anywhere except at the artillerystations, but it left
								those men totally vulnerable. And while the Blackguardshad all hit their target—now
								slumped on the floor, bleeding out and barelysmoking—the other defenders wouldn’t be so
								accurate. The cowltransformed the top of the wall into a yellow luxin tunnel. That
								meantricochets. Ricochets meant anyone who missed a shot at an attacker wouldprobably
								kill a defender. It wasn’t worth the tradeoffs, especially becauseKing Garadul’s
								culverins and howitzers had stopped firing so they wouldn’tkill the color wights.
							</p>

							<p>
								General Danavis must have realized the same thing, though, becausebefore the Blackguards
								could argue that they couldn’t send even one oftheir own away from Gavin, the cowl slid
								back. The sudden motionknocked several defenders off the wall, the fall guaranteeing
								maiming ordeath. But it had to be done.
							</p>

							<p>
								It also snapped the slide that the Blackguards had made for Gavin. Butin moments they
								remade it and threw him unceremoniously down. Hecouldn’t even catch himself. The sheer
								amount of luxin he’d drafted todayhad left him with nothing.
							</p>

							<p>
								The Blackguards at the bottom of the slide caught him and lifted him tohis feet. He was
								able to stand.“Take me to the gate,” Gavin ordered.The Blackguards looked at each
								other.“Damn you! Lose the gate, lose the wall. We lose the wall, we lose thecity.”“This
								city isn’t our concern. Your safety is,” a voice shouted.
							</p>

							<p>
								Tremblefist. He’d appeared from nowhere. “You can stand, can you run?”he asked
								Gavin.“I’m not running!”“We can’t hold the gate!” Tremblefist shouted. “My Guards are
								gettingslaughtered, and for what? We’re not your personal army. We protect yourlife, not
								your whims. You’re making our job impossible!”
							</p>

							<p>
								Gavin’s failure spun out before him. This was his own fault. It wasn’this drafting that
								had failed, it was his leadership. He’d never told these menand women why they fought.
								He’d demanded obedience unto death withouteven telling them why it was important. He’d
								been divided in his own mindand now he was surprised that they didn’t want to die for
								that? A lie wouldhave been better.
							</p>

							<p>
								All he could see through the press of the soldiers between himself andthe gate was
								flashes of fire, and smoke, and blood splashed high against thearch. The Blackguards
								were doubtless still in the front line—only theBlackguard could have stood for so long
								against the number of color wightsGavin had seen coming. The crackle of musket fire was
								constant but slow.The soldiers between Gavin and the fight had no idea about
								establishing firelanes, so men farther back didn’t shoot for fear of striking those in
								front ofthem. But so far, no one was turning back.
							</p>

							<p>
								Of course, that would change when they saw their best fighters retreat,abandon them. The
								Blackguards were the linchpin.
							</p>

							<p>
								With a roar of frustration, Gavin grabbed a nearby soldier’s musket andran toward the
								gate. He could hear Tremblefist’s curse, and had no doubtthe big man would be hot on his
								heels. He pushed and weaved through thecrowd, his size slowing him, but not as much as
								Tremblefist’s even biggersize.
							</p>

							<p>
								Gavin was cursing, screaming at men and women to move out of hisway, when he heard a
								crunch of impact. A moment later, there was a surgefrom the gate, pushing everyone back
								a good five paces. Gavin cut across aline of soldiers to the wall. He grappled across a
								section where the image ofa huge warrior stood, stoic, unmoving except for breathing,
								little puffs ofsteam escaping from his mouth. He touched a few sections—damn it,
								heshould have done something to demarcate the appropriate place—until hefound the one he
								was looking for. He touched it—anyone could touch it, itactivated from the heat in a
								man’s hand—and a little window of the wallwent transparent.
							</p>

							<p>
								He was right. The crunch had been the impact of the regular soldiersarriving. There were
								tens of thousands of them pressed against the wallright now, already hefting scaling
								ladders and ropes. He couldn’t wait forthem to find his little surprise—but none of that
								mattered if they couldn’thold the gate.
							</p>

							<p>
								Looking to the sun, Gavin saw it was touching the horizon. Not longnow. If they could
								make it until the sun had fully set, the drafters’ powerwould be more than halved. They
								could still draft from diffracted light, butnot nearly as strongly. He started running
								again, pushing through men andwomen directly against the wall. He heard the whistle of
								an incomingmortar.
							</p>

							<p>
								The pitch was familiar, horribly familiar. A sound that replayed in hisnightmares. You
								could hear death coming, but other than cowering on theground, there wasn’t anything you
								could do to avoid it. The thump andboom of the shell landing and exploding going Thboom,
								shatteringeardrums and blasting men off their feet. This one was getting really
								reallyloud—
							</p>

							<p>
								Gavin dropped to the ground and covered his head with his arms.
							</p>

							<p>
								Something heavy crushed him farther into the ground, and the worldoutside went blue.
							</p>

							<p>
								Thump!Tremblefist rolled off Gavin and dissolved the blue shield he’d draftedover them
								both. Gavin stared at the cannon shell, embedded in the earth notten paces away. It
								hadn’t exploded. It hadn’t even crushed anyone. It hadlanded right between two lines of
								soldiers. One man was dancing around,shaking his hand. His crushed musket lay beneath
								the mortar itself, knockedout of his hand by the shell. It was right about where Gavin
								had been beforehe cut toward the wall.“Orholam’s hand is on you indeed, you damn fool
								Prism,” Tremblefistsaid.
							</p>

							<p>
								Gavin was already up and pushing toward the heaving, bulging lines infront of him. The
								men here had already fired their muskets and there was noway to reload. Some had fixed
								bayonets, the knife handles set inside theopen barrels. Others had drawn swords. Others
								were using muskets asclubs.
							</p>

							<p>
								Over their heads, musket fire rang out from the murder holes and stonesthe size of a
								man’s head were thrown through the machicolations in thearch. But no luxin poured down.
								Either the drafters above had exhaustedthemselves long ago, or they’d been killed, or
								they had never made it totheir positions.
							</p>

							<p>
								One more day, Orholam. One more day, and this wall would have beenimpregnable. One more
								hour.
							</p>

							<p>
								Gavin pushed into the melee at last. The area around the gate was acharnel house. The
								stench of magic and gore mingled. Blood covered theground thickly enough that the
								combatants splashed it up around their legsas they fought. The bodies of men and
								monsters mingled, tripped upattackers and defenders. A pile of bodies filled the area
								directly beneath thegate, and as King Garadul’s men climbed up and over them, that made
								themtargets for the soldiers farther back in Gavin’s army who otherwise couldn’tshoot
								for fear of hitting their own men. Gavin saw a Blackguard fall, her legripped open by a
								glasslike jagged foot claw of an exhausted blue wight.
							</p>

							<p>
								His musket roared and the wight’s head exploded in red mist. Gavinflung the musket at a
								burning red wight that was moving to embrace awounded soldier who was backed up against
								the wall, weaponless. Hedidn’t see what happened. He grabbed the wounded Blackguard and
								tried tohaul her to her feet.
							</p>

							<p>
								She was far heavier than she should have been. Gavin blinked, hisexhaustion coming back
								to him in a rush. No, he was just weak. Someonegrabbed the wounded woman from him and
								hauled her off, and the soundsof the battle took on an eerie, tinny quality. He could
								hear incoming mortars—too distant to matter, but several of them. He could hear men
								screaming,the wordless roars of those running to what they knew was likely death.
								Heheard the whimpers of the wounded, saw a woman in that great pile ofbodies at the gate
								trying to crawl away, wounded but not dead. Next to her aman was clawing at the air,
								blind because he was missing half of his face.Luxin fires burned on a dozen corpses, and
								luxin dust was everywhere.Gavin caught a glimpse of the faces of his Blackguards. He
								could see theirdelight, their sudden purpose—where were the rest of them? They
								wererushing over to him.
							</p>

							<p>
								He pulled his pistols from his sash. The red wight, body covered in pyrejelly, his
								entire form burning, ran toward him. If Gavin hadn’t arrived solate to the battle, it
								would have drafted instead and incinerated him. Hepulled the trigger. His dagger-pistol,
								being Ilytian make, fired instantly. Theball punched into the red wight’s chest but
								didn’t stop its momentum. Gavinstepped to the side and slashed the blade of the dagger
								across the wight’sthroat as it fell. He stumbled, almost went down.
							</p>

							<p>
								He was more aware of than actually saw the two Blackguards streak pasthim. By the time
								he recovered and was standing once more, one Blackguardhad been impaled on a great blue
								luxin sword that a blue wight had draftedin the place of its right arm. Even dying, the
								Blackguard had latched onwith both hands to keep the wight from throwing him clear. The
								otherBlackguard—Gavin thought his name was Amestan—had circled thecreature and hacked a
								sword at its neck. Once, twice—blue luxin shardsexploding at each great impact. The
								creature struggled to free itself butcouldn’t. On the third cut, Amestan’s sword broke
								through the blue luxinand went into its neck. That wight’s will was broken, and
								Amestan’s fourthcut severed its head.
							</p>

							<p>
								One of King Garadul’s Mirrormen—what the hell were they doing here?—came over the top of
								the bodies piled chest deep, scrabbling, using hishands, his drawn sword awkward. He saw
								Amestan’s back to him andcharged.
							</p>

							<p>
								Instinctively, Gavin tried to lash out with luxin, but even the touch ofmagic made him
								want to vomit. It was like offering drink to a man with ahangover. He weaved, almost
								lost consciousness, leveled the pistol, fired.
							</p>

							<p>
								At the last moment, Amestan spun to face his attacker—and moveddirectly into the line of
								fire. Gavin’s shot blew off the back of his head. Asecond later, the Mirrorman ran
								Amestan through, but he was already dead.“No!” Gavin yelled. An entire line of Mirrormen
								appeared over the pileof bodies. King Garadul had realized the same thing Gavin had. The
								gatehad to be taken tonight, or the wall would never be taken at all. So the kinghad
								sent his own personal guard to get it done. There were only maybethirty Blackguards
								left, and the appearance of the dazzling Mirrormenwould easily be enough to make the
								defenders break. Especially without theBlackguards.
							</p>

							<p>
								It wasn’t right that so much valor should result in failure. So muchdeath. Gavin wasn’t
								thinking clearly. He knew that. He didn’t care.
							</p>

							<p>
								As the sun’s last rays kissed the earth, Gavin drafted. It was likedrinking vomit. It
								was like diving headfirst into sewage. It was too much forhis body. He didn’t care. He
								threw everything he had into this. This wasn’tfor Gavin Guile. To hell with Gavin Guile.
								This was for everyone who’dfought and died for him. They’d stood for him. He couldn’t
								fail them, noteven if it meant his life.
							</p>

							<p>
								The magic was like a second sun being born within the gate arch. Inmoments, it was born,
								stood, and leapt forward. The Mirrormen becameradiant, their mirror armor reflecting
								light a thousand directions. But mirrorarmor was to magic like normal armor was to
								weapons: good for deflectingglancing blows, but nowhere close to invincible. A rushing
								wind filledGavin’s ears an instant before a cone of pure magic swept through him
								andblasted forth, exploding to the width of the entire gate. The gate becamelike the
								barrel of a vast cannon. The Mirrormen went incandescent, standingfor a moment longer
								than seemed possible, their armor glowing, thenglowing red-hot, then glowing white-hot,
								then ripping apart like everythingelse.
							</p>

							<p>
								A concussion rocked the earth at the power of the blast, and only Gavindidn’t fall. He
								rode the earth, magic bursting forth like he was nothing morethan the tip of a volcano,
								the barrel of a musket.
							</p>

							<p>
								Then, not five seconds after it started, it was gone.The gate area was scoured clean.
								The bodies were gone, and a wide areaaround the gate on King Garadul’s side was scorched
								and blackened.
							</p>

							<p>
								There was stunned silence—either that, or Gavin had gone deaf. Hestood, looking out, and
								a figure stumbled into his view. A big man, dressedin rich clothes, now blackened. King
								Garadul. Evidently the man hadn’t justsent his personal guards to attack the gate; he’d
								come with them.
							</p>

							<p>
								Gavin and Garadul stood, facing each other, forty paces away. Gavincould read the awe
								and uncertainty in the big man’s very stance.
							</p>

							<p>
								Then Gavin’s body gave out. He collapsed. There was something whitein the dirt near his
								face, or he was going blind. Spots swam in every colorbefore his eyes.
							</p>

							<p>
								Men were lifting him, carrying him away, and he heard the distantsounds of renewed
								battle. As the Blackguards lifted him, surrounding himwith their bodies and withdrawing
								from the field, he saw King Garadulthrough the open gate, charging the gate—alone.
								Whatever else Gavin haddone, he’d destroyed the barricade and every other impediment in
								that area.A few men joined their king. The dirt around Rask was exploding in littlepuffs
								as snipers tried to kill him, but none hit. It was like the man wascharmed, blessed,
								protected by some old god mightier than Orholam.
							</p>

							<p>
								Then Gavin saw Tremblefist’s bloodied, gunpowder-streaked face.“Forgive me, Lord Prism,”
								the Blackguard was saying. “You did everythingyou could. More. Now—” Then Gavin lost
								consciousness.
							</p>

							<p>
								Chapter 74
							</p>

							<p>
								As night fell, the plain didn’t darken. At first, Liv had no idea why. She hadbeen
								walking all day, stuck behind the wagon, wearing an old petasos withthe brim low so her
								drafter’s eyes would be less conspicuous. She’d heardthe rumble of guns earlier, but
								assumed it was posturing. There was no waythe army was at Garriston yet. Along with what
								appeared to be half of theentire camp, she went forward to see what was so bright.
							</p>

							<p>
								There were so many people covering the plain that Liv almost missedthe signs of the
								battle that had concluded mere hours before, obvious asthey were. Trenches where
								cannonballs had landed simply became ditchesfor the wagons to avoid. Slippery, muddy,
								bloody areas next to thosecannon scars, with fragments of armor littered about, were
								just places towatch your footing in the near-darkness. The pungent aroma of gunpowderwas
								already dissipating.
							</p>

							<p>
								The last of the great lines of soldiers were marching through the gateeven now, forcing
								all the camp followers to wait until after they’d goneinside and set up camp. Liv heard
								wild rumors of huge magicalconflagrations, an epic battle, but she was skeptical. King
								Garadul’s armyhad taken the wall in an afternoon. It couldn’t have been much of a
								fight.Her father was a great general. He’d only lost one battle in his life, and
								thatbarely. He must have decided that they wouldn’t finish the wall in time andhad
								withdrawn to the city walls. He’d probably just had some cannoneersstay to inflict some
								easy damage on King Garadul’s men and then withdraw.
							</p>

							<p>
								The thought made Liv feel better. If her father had chosen to make hisstand elsewhere,
								then he surely wouldn’t have been in danger today. Theidea that he might have fought and
								died less than a league away and that shehadn’t had so much as a sick intuition was too
								terrible to entertain. She’dbeen so caught up in looking for Kip that she hadn’t even
								realized they werethis close to the city.
							</p>

							<p>
								But all thoughts and worries and distractions faded as she pushedthrough the crowds
								lined up looking at the wall. No one went within fiftypaces of it. As Liv finally pushed
								to the front, she saw why. An enormousspider, larger than a man, had strung up a dozen
								corpses—no, not corpses,at least one of the web-wrapped bundles was struggling. As Liv
								watched,the man tore his head free, his hands bound tight up against his chest.Upside
								down, the man wriggled, trying to free his arm, setting himselfswinging gently. The
								spider didn’t notice as it tended to another bundle tenpaces away.
							</p>

							<p>
								Liv saw a sword stuck in the ground not far from the man. He tore hisright arm free and
								began clawing at the rest of the webs holding him, butcouldn’t rip them open. Then he
								saw the sword. He swung, reaching for it.Didn’t quite reach it.“Orholam save him!”
								someone breathed in the crowd.“Look at the spider!”The spider had frozen as if it heard
								something. Then it turned, just as theman swung farther. It turned, eyes glowing a
								sickly green.
							</p>

							<p>
								The man’s hands closed on the sword hilt just as the spider pounced. Heswung, missed,
								and the spider’s jaws closed on his neck. For one terribleinstant the man’s entire body
								tensed, face contorting in pain. Then thoseawful jaws scissored together, and his head
								fell to the ground and rolled.His free arm—still holding the sword—spasmed for several
								long momentsas blood gushed out of his neck onto the ground. Then he dropped thesword.
								It speared into the ground, right where he’d left it.
							</p>

							<p>
								The spider latched onto his bleeding neck and began feeding.Liv heard someone retch.
								Others muttered prayers and curses.She was transfixed, as was everyone else. Eventually,
								the spider pushedthe man’s arm back against his chest and wrapped him in webs once
								more.Then it picked up his head and put it back with his body.
							</p>

							<p>
								While the spider was fixing the webs, wrapping the man’s head back inplace, one of the
								other bundles began moving.“I been watching for two hours,” a man next to Liv said.
								“They don’tnone of them get away. This fella gets about thirty paces before she rips
								outhis guts. Them two try to fight her together. It’s the same every time. Iknow it, but
								I can’t stop watching.”
							</p>

							<p>
								The same every time? Liv looked back to the first man and position ofthe sword below
								him. It was the same as before—exactly the same. Theblood that that pooled beneath his
								severed head had slowly receded tonothingness. This wasn’t a murder; it was a mummer’s
								show. Whichactually didn’t make it any less impressive.“What are you doing?” someone
								called out behind Liv.She hadn’t even realized she was walking forward, but she didn’t
								stop.
							</p>

							<p>
								As she got closer, it became more and more apparent that she’d been right.She walked
								closer as—sure enough—the second man tore free and ranaway. But then the spider stopped
								in its pursuit, froze, and turned. Thecrowd behind Liv gasped. The spider bounded back
								with great speed, goingstraight for Liv.
							</p>

							<p>
								Liv froze, her heart leaping into her throat. The spider stopped, right infront of her,
								great pincer jaws snapping together, forelegs lifted to grab her.Too frightened to move,
								Liv watched those jaws clack-clack together, notten paces away. Clack-clack…
							</p>

							<p>
								Soundlessly?Liv let out a breath she hadn’t realized she was holding. She tightenedher
								eyes and saw that the ground around her was laced with superviolettriggers. Brilliant.
								She stepped to her left, and the spider didn’t move untilshe stepped into the next zone,
								and then it was there, fast. And now that shewas this close, she could see that the
								cavern behind the spider looked allwrong. It wasn’t nearly as deep as it appeared from
								fifty paces out. It waslike a painting, with light and shadow used to make it appear
								that there wasan entire cave where there was none. And the spider itself was
								craftedentirely of primary, stable luxin colors, layered so that it wouldn’t beobvious
								that it was a luxin creation.
							</p>

							<p>
								As Liv moved past the triggers, the spider went bounding after the manwho had “escaped,”
								but somehow hadn’t taken advantage of the last thirtyseconds to actually run away. The
								spider ripped out his guts, just as the manhad said.
							</p>

							<p>
								Liv touched the luxin of the wall and immediately forgot about thegenius of the spider
								mummery. The yellow luxin was flawless. It wasperfection.
							</p>

							<p>
								Forgetting where she was, she drafted directly from the yellow glow ofthe wall. Drafting
								from yellow luxin had once been pursued as the perfectsource of light—at least for
								yellows—but it had never panned out.Something was always lost, it was always
								inefficient. But with an entirewall, leagues long, inefficiency didn’t matter. Liv drew
								a little torch of solidluxin into her hand to better see the wall when illuminated by a
								secondsource of light. Sometimes drafters hid things in their construction that—“Hey!
								Mistress! What are you doing out here? All drafters are supposedto be inside the walls
								already.”
							</p>

							<p>
								Startled, Liv saw a grizzled old soldier coming toward her, wearing theuniform of a
								Tyrean sergeant, a brace of nice wheellock pistols at his beltand an empty scabbard. His
								face was smudged with gunpowder or smokeand there were light bandages wrapped around his
								hands. He glanced atLiv’s forearms as he approached.“I, uh—” She tried desperately to
								remember the lie she’d prepared incase someone asked her about her lack of the colored
								vambraces.“You’re dazzled by Brightwater Wall. I know, all the drafters is.
							</p>

							<p>
								Where’re your arms?”
							</p>

							<p>
								Arms? Liv guessed he meant the color vambraces all the other drafterswore. “I, ahem, was
								invited to the color lords’ party last night and I had abit much to drink, I’m afraid. I
								fell asleep behind a bush and my unit eitherdidn’t find me or thought it would be funny
								to leave me there mostly,ahem…”“Naked?”Liv blushed as much from the brazenness of her
								lie as anything. “I’mlucky I still have my specs,” she said, showing him her yellow
								spectaclestucked in a pocket.“I’d probably drink a lot if I were asked to that party
								myself. Put on yourspecs and go to the gate. They’ll let you through. Then go to
								QuartermasterZid. He’s a real bastard and he’ll give you all sorts of trouble, but…
								Ah,hell. Come with me, I’ll take you. That’s me, Master Sergeant GalanDelelo, sucker for
								a pouty lip and a clueless gaze.”“Hey!” Liv said.“Joking, joking,” Galan said. “You
								actually remind me of my daughter.
							</p>

							<p>
								And if she’s clueless, she got it all from her father. Come on.” He turned.“And you, all
								you damned fools, it ain’t real. It’s just a show. Stop piddlingyourselves.” He slapped
								the wall to emphasize his point and half the crowdducked at the sharp sound.
							</p>

							<p>
								Mumbling to himself, he took her to the gate. Even the soldierscontinued to march
								through. They’d left a narrow two lanes on one side formessengers and nobles and
								drafters to pass, and the guards there knew themaster sergeant and let him right
								through.
							</p>

							<p>
								Inside the wall, he weaved quickly between tents, walking fast, and cutto the front of a
								line of lower-ranking soldiers to speak with thequartermaster. “Need yellow rags for
								this girl here,” Galan announced to thequartermaster’s back as the big, hunchbacked man
								was collecting half adozen swords to give to some young soldier.
							</p>

							<p>
								Quartermaster Zid turned. “I don’t recognize her. She’s not with theunits I supply.
								Forget it.”“You’re going to give me hell? Tonight? You crazy old ninny, do I needto put
								my foot up your arse?”“Ninny? You come harping on me like a harridan and you expect
								rosesand wine? I ought to pound that ugly nose of yours flat,” the hunchbackedman said.
							</p>

							<p>
								Galan laughed, rubbing a nose that had obviously been broken manytimes. “I seem to
								recall you trying that a time or two.”
							</p>

							<p>
								The quartermaster grinned, and Liv’s terror faded as she realized the twowere good
								friends.“I know you’re happy to see I’m alive,” Galan said. “So just do me afavor and
								give the girl the rags.”“Yellow?” Zid asked. He poured the swords onto the counter,
								ignoringthe young soldier who tried and failed to grab all of them and almostskewered
								himself trying—unsuccessfully—to keep them on the counter.“Yes,” Liv said.He grabbed a
								list. “Name?”“Liv.”He scanned quickly. “No Livs, sorry. There’s not a yellow drafter
								named
							</p>

							<p>
								Liv in the entire army.”
							</p>

							<p>
								Liv’s mouth went dry.“You and you,” Zid said, pointing to some soldiers waiting,
								irritated, inline. “Arrest this woman. We’ll need to report an impostor—”“Oh for
								Orholam’s sake, Zid, whaddaya think she is, a spy? She’sprobably barely sixteen! What
								kind of a swiving fool would send a baby tospy on us?”
							</p>

							<p>
								At the word “spy” Liv’s knees turned to water.“Maybe a very cunning fool, who thought we
								would discount her forthat very reason,” Zid said, suspicion leaking out of his very
								pores. “Theysay Gavin Guile did. They say some boy over in the chirurgeons’ tents ishis
								own bastard. Who’d send a child? Those wily bastards, that’s who.” Henodded vaguely
								toward Garriston.“I’m seventeen,” she said instead. What? Kip was in the
								chirurgeons’tents? Was he sick? Wounded? She was too flustered and scared to rejoicethat
								she’d just heard her first lead to Kip’s whereabouts.“Come on, Zid, those lists are
								barely good enough to wipe your arse ononce the fighting starts, you know that. It’s
								like you’ve never done this bef—”“Gotcha,” Zid said. He threw back his head and laughed.
								He threw someyellow sleeves across the table. “That was for the ‘ninny’ crack. Now
								we’reeven.”“Even, oh, we’re not even close to even,” Galan said, but he wassmiling.
								“Meh, duty calls, nice to meetcha, Liv, and if you ever can, knockthis fella down a
								notch or three, wouldja?”“Gladly,” Liv said, smiling over the sick feeling in her
								stomach, as if shewere glad to be in on the joke.
							</p>

							<p>
								In minutes, she was alone and, donning her sleeves for the first time, shewas in. Now
								all she had to do was save Kip and Karris. And really, howhard could that be?
							</p>

							<p>
								Not for the first time in the last few days, Liv wanted to swear and throwthings and
								whine and complain, and—maybe just a little—she wanted tocry. Instead, she took a deep
								breath and headed deeper into camp.
							</p>

							<p>
								Chapter 75
							</p>

							<p>
								When Gavin opened his eyes, it was bright out. There was a figure sittingbeside his bed.
								He looked at her. His mother.“Oh, thank Orholam. I thought I was awake,” Gavin
								said.Felia Guile laughed, and he knew he wasn’t dreaming. His mother’slaughter sounded
								somehow freer than it had in years. “It’s almost noon, son.I know I hardly have to
								lecture you on duty, but you really should get up.”“Noon?” Gavin sat bolt upright. It
								was a mistake. His whole body hurt.
							</p>

							<p>
								His head hurt. His eyes hurt. He held himself still while the hammer blowsto the back of
								his head receded from ten-weight sledges to five-weightsledges and his eyes found focus
								once more. He usually didn’t get lightsick—but then, he’d never used so much magic as he
								had yesterday, either. Notsince Sundered Rock, and he’d been young then. “It’s almost
								noon on SunDay?” he asked.“We thought it best to spare you greeting the sun and the
								dawnprocessional. It was going be a more informal Sun Day this year, regardless.Orholam
								will forgive us.”“Mother, what are you doing here?”“It’s time… Gavin.”“Time?”“For my
								Freeing.”Gavin felt a wave of cold dread course down his body from head to toe.
							</p>

							<p>
								No. Not his mother. She’d said sometime in the next five years. She’d givenhim time to
								prepare, but it couldn’t be this early. “Father?” he asked instead.
							</p>

							<p>
								She folded her hands in her lap, her voice holding quiet dignity. “Yourfather has made
								far too many decisions for me. The Freeing is between adrafter and Orholam.”“So he
								doesn’t know,” Gavin said.“I’m sure he knows by now,” she said, a little sparkle in her
								eyes.“You ran away?” And that would have been what it was, too. She wouldhave slipped
								out at night, bribed a ship captain some obscene amount, andgone before Andross Guile’s
								spies could even report back. She would havechosen the fastest ship in port so that even
								if Andross sent a ship with thenext tide, his men would still arrive too late. It was,
								Gavin had to admit,brilliant.
							</p>

							<p>
								And it would not go over well with Andross Guile. Not at all.She was quiet for a long
								moment. “Son, I’ve told your father I wished tojoin the Freeing every year for the last
								five years. He forbade it. I can feelmyself slipping away. I haven’t drafted for three
								years, and my life feelsgray. I love your father dearly, but he’s always been a very
								selfish man.Andross wants to hold on to his life and his power forever, and he
								doesn’twant to be alone. I… pity him, son, and I’ve given him these years for thelove we
								once shared. You know I’m loyal, but we both know he’ll see thisas a betrayal. And I
								know that he’ll blame you rather than himself, but if Ihave to choose between my duty to
								your father and my duty to Orholam…”“Orholam wins.”She patted his knee. “I’ve sent a
								courier to Corvan Danavis—”“Corvan’s alive? At the wall, I was afraid…”She smiled sadly.
								“He’s well. But your defenders lost the wall, despiteyour heroics.”
							</p>

							<p>
								My heroics. Only his mother could talk about his heroics without a hintof irony in her
								voice. What would you think about that, down in yourprison, brother?“Anyway, I’ve sent a
								courier to let him know you’re awake. I’m glad tosee him again. He’s a good man.” She
								knew, of course, that Corvan hadtaken a life in exile in order for Gavin’s masquerade to
								work, but as always,she was circumspect, just in case there were spies eavesdropping.
								Gavin’smother had always had a gift for figuring out how to live her life and let
								heropinions be known despite the pressures of court life and the demands ofprotocol,
								secrecy, and discretion. “I’ll see you tonight, son.”
							</p>

							<p>
								Gavin got dressed slowly after she left, testing his body to see if he’ddone any
								permanent damage with yesterday’s exertions. He was sore, but hesurely deserved worse.
								His muscles would loosen up as the day progressed,and he thought he’d be ready to draft
								the necessities this evening. Past noonon a Sun Day.
							</p>

							<p>
								There was a quick little flurry of light knocks on the door, the tempo ofan old song he
								and Corvan used to enjoy. The door opened.
							</p>

							<p>
								Corvan came in. “You’re up.” He sounded surprised.“Not much the worse for wear. Thanks
								for letting me sleep in, but youknow you need my help today. What’s the situation?”
								Gavin was lacing uphis shirt.
							</p>

							<p>
								Corvan grabbed Gavin’s face in both of his hands and stared in his eyes.
							</p>

							<p>
								Gavin slapped his hands to knock them away, but Corvan held him firmly.“What the hell
								are you doing?” Gavin demanded.“You should be dead,” Corvan said. “Do you remember how
								much youdrafted yesterday?”“I remember it vividly, thank you, including quite a headache
								that you’renot making any better.”
							</p>

							<p>
								After staring for a few more moments, Corvan released him. “I’m sorry,
							</p>

							<p>
								Lord Prism. They say there are signs when a Prism starts dying. I have noidea what they
								are, but I figured if anything would break you, it would bewhat you did yesterday. Even
								a Prism shouldn’t be able to draft that much.But your eyes look fine.”
							</p>

							<p>
								Gavin shrugged it off. “How did we lose the wall?”Corvan blew out a breath. “Rask
								Garadul is either brilliant and crazy, orjust crazy, that’s how.”“So no one shot that
								moron as he charged the gate?”“They got lucky. I think you scared both sides half to
								death with… withwhat you did. The snipers were shaking so hard they couldn’t hit an
								easytarget. Then, when the men saw that Rask was charging and you had fallen,they
								thought you were dead—that he’d somehow defeated you. TheBlackguards pulled out to take
								you to safety and most of the best Tyreanswe had had already been killed in the
								fighting.” He pinched his nosebetween his eyes. Tension headaches. Gavin had forgotten
								how Corvanalways got those when there was fighting to be done. Gavin could imagineit
								now—the Prism down, the elite Blackguards suddenly pulling out, andthe enemy charging as
								if unfazed by all Gavin had done. No wonder theTyreans had lost courage.“So King
								Garadul’s men joined his charge and what… our men melted?
							</p>

							<p>
								Got massacred? What?”“They actually held the gate for a few minutes. They bungled the
								trooprefresher maneuvers I tried to teach them, though.” That was when freshmusketeers
								with loaded weapons would switch with the frontline troops.“But they were passing loaded
								muskets up the ranks, handing back firedmuskets to be reloaded. They were losing ground,
								but not fast, and the walldefenses were holding. It was getting dark—I thought we were
								going tohold it.”“And then?”“They ran out of powder.” He sighed. Gavin could tell that
								the generaltook it as a personal failure. “There was plenty elsewhere, of course.
								I’dsent men to take care of it, but… war happens.” Confusion, or spies, or thecouriers
								being killed, or the wagon men who were supposed to bring theblack powder forward
								deserting, on top of officers not checking back in anddouble-checking that the orders
								had been followed, either through their owninexperience or cowardice or death. Any link
								in the entire chain could breakwith an army in which few men had trained at all, and few
								units had trainedtogether. It was simply that the supply of black powder was the link
								that hadbroken.
							</p>

							<p>
								Of course, that wouldn’t have mattered if Gavin had built the damnedgate first. Or if
								he’d been stronger. Or if that cannonball hadn’t crashedthrough his forms. But
								second-guessing was futile.“Our defenders broke and ran,” Corvan said. “King Garadul
								didn’t sendanyone after us. I managed a fairly orderly retreat for the men in the wall.
								Isuppose Garadul thinks we’ll surrender. Maybe he thought mercy wouldaccomplish his
								objectives more quickly than wiping out as many men as hecould. Or he didn’t want his
								men killing each other in the darkness. Or he’sdevout and this new religion of his
								forbids night fighting.”“Old religion, I think,” Gavin said.“They’re not giving any sign
								of attacking today.”“Sun Day is holy even to pagans,” Gavin said.“So we have until
								tomorrow. What do you want to do, Lord Prism?”“When you thought I was incapacitated,
								what did you decide to do?”“Whatever goodwill King Garadul gained in the city by sparing
								the menwho fled yesterday, he more than lost by using color wights in battle. Thecity is
								wild with tales of monsters. They’re terrified. Two days ago, I wasworried they would
								turn against us in a heartbeat. They watched you build awall to protect them, and they
								saw what you were protecting them from. Sonow they trust you and they revile the man who
								slaughtered their friendswith the help of abominations. This whole city is yours. If you
								show yourface, they’ll follow you to the gates of the evernight.”“Corvan. The
								question.”Corvan rubbed his neck. Hesitated. “We can’t win. The old stone wallaround the
								city couldn’t keep out a determined mule. Rask took most of ourgunpowder when he took
								the wall, and all of our cannons. Half our musketswere left on the field as men dropped
								them when they fled. We’d be luckyto kill a few thousand before they took the inner
								wall, and once we startfighting street to street, we could kill quite a few at some
								choke points, buteventually their numbers guarantee it will be a slaughter. With
								theirnumbers and our lack of matériel, this city is indefensible. There’s nostrategy I
								can imagine in which we win. We can hurt them badly while welose, but that’s not the
								same.” He grimaced. “I was preparing a retreat.”“A retreat.” Corvan Danavis had never
								lost a battle—well, if one didn’tcount Sundered Rock as a loss, which Gavin didn’t. If
								you mean to lose,and you do, in exactly the way you intended, it’s not really a loss, is
								it?“Even a retreat is beset with unforeseen difficulties, Lord Prism. Thepresence of the
								‘monsters’ that put everyone in the city on our side alsomeans everyone in the city
								wants out. They think they’ll be slaughtered andeaten if they stay, and there’s no way
								we can evacuate so many people withthe ships and the time we have.”
							</p>

							<p>
								Gavin rubbed his forehead. Threw on his ceremonial white cloak.
							</p>

							<p>
								Stalled, basically. “Have our spies reported anything about Karris?” heasked, trying to
								sound disinterested. Not that Corvan would be fooled.“Still alive as of yesterday. I
								imagine he was planning to use her tobarter with, if he needed to.” Which now, of
								course, he wouldn’t. MeaningKarris had become expendable. Corvan didn’t have to say it
								aloud.“Kip or Liv or Ironfist?” If Gavin had been thinking, or a little less
								self-centered, he’d have asked about Corvan’s daughter first.“No word,” Corvan said. His
								jaw was tight.“Which could be good news, right? If they’d done anything disastrous,our
								spies would be more likely to hear about it, right?”
							</p>

							<p>
								Corvan didn’t say anything for a while, refusing to take such weaksolace. He wasn’t a
								man to grasp after straws or to believe that tragedycouldn’t befall him. The deaths of
								two wives had cured him of idealism.“Our spies did report that there’s some kind of king
								of the color wights, apolychrome wight. They’re calling him Lord Omnichrome. No word
								onwho he was before breaking the Pact—unless he’s a true wild polychrome.”
							</p>

							<p>
								Gavin shrugged. Just another problem among hundreds, but he knew
							</p>

							<p>
								Corvan was laying all the potential problems on the table so Gavin couldmake his own
								choices about what was and was not important.“What do you want to do, Lord Prism?”He
								meant about the battle or the evacuation, of course.“I want to kill Rask Garadul.”Corvan
								said nothing, didn’t move to order an assassination or somethingsimilarly stupid.
							</p>

							<p>
								Damn him, but Gavin’s father had predicted even this. If you lose thecity, kill Rask
								Garadul, Andross Guile had said. Gavin had been sure hecould save the city—and hadn’t
								arranged assassins to kill Rask. He shouldhave done both. Too late now, unless Rask
								charged him tomorrow asfoolishly as he had done yesterday.
							</p>

							<p>
								Gavin moved to speak, but the words wouldn’t come. He cleared histhroat, trying to
								remove the taste of failure. “I’ll help as much as I can whileperforming my religious
								duties, but…” He cleared his throat again. Sevenyears, seven great purposes. Here I was
								trying to do something good foronce. “I’ve failed, Corvan. Order the evacuation.”
							</p>

							<p>
								Chapter 76
							</p>

							<p>
								Judging from the cold air licking his skin, it was well after midnight whenKip was
								escorted through some kind of gate. He had to judge from thetemperature because he was
								wearing a blindfold, along with a black sackover his head, a noose around his neck,
								hands bound behind his back.
							</p>

							<p>
								One of the guards who was accompanying him was cursing, quietly butconstantly, awed by
								something apparently called Brightwater Wall. Theypassed through slowly, stopping and
								starting, some military sounding voicebarking, “Don’t stand there and pick your butts.
								Move deeper into camp.You’re blocking everyone else.” Kip heard the crack of a whip like
								a pistolshot, and the line started moving again.
							</p>

							<p>
								The last couple of days had been like this. Kip had woken in darkness—darkness that
								turned out to be a blindfold, his hands bound at his sides.When he struggled to get it
								off, men had come. They removed the blindfold,one stared at his eyes, pulling them wide
								open with rough fingers, then theyblindfolded him again. His left hand was agony. That
								first day—if it wasjust a day—they had dosed his wine with something foul that dulled
								hispain and his senses.
							</p>

							<p>
								They’d taken him to see Lord Omnichrome, withholding Kip’s dosedwine so he would be
								lucid, but they never removed the blindfold. They’dsat in a tent with many voices for
								hours, with Kip in agony, and then they’dleft. Apparently the lord was too busy to see
								him.
							</p>

							<p>
								After a while, Kip heard his guards arguing. A clever man would havefigured out some way
								to exploit their divisions. Kip just stood quietly,wondering when his next dose would
								be. His hand was throbbing.
							</p>

							<p>
								They handed him off to someone else—literally handing over the noosearound his
								neck.“Aren’t you going to give him the poppy wine?” one of his guardsasked.“Why waste
								good poppy on bad blubber?” the other guard asked. “I likepoppy wine my own self.”“Oh,
								that stuff tastes foul,” the first said. Kip could agree with that.“I don’t drink it for
								the taste,” the guard said, laughing. Kip could agreewith that too. “Let’s go. I saw
								some women a ways back. With your charmand my poppy wine…” He laughed again.
							</p>

							<p>
								Kip was pulled into a wagon. He stumbled up the steps and nearlystrangled on the noose,
								but soon found his seat. The door was closed behindhim.
							</p>

							<p>
								Someone loosened his noose, pulled it off, took off his hood, pulled offhis blindfold.
								“Kip?” she asked.
							</p>

							<p>
								Kip blinked. Though the light in the violet room was dim, after two daysin total
								darkness it made his eyes water nonetheless. But through the blearof his tears, he made
								out Karris White Oak.“Karris?” he asked. Stupid question. Of course it’s her, you’re
								looking ather, you idiot.“Kip, what are you doing here?”“I’m here to rescue you,” he
								said. Then he laughed.“Kip, how much poppy wine did they give you?”It had been hours
								since they’d given him wine, but he just laughedharder.
							</p>

							<p>
								Karris guided Kip to her pallet in the wagon. He fell asleep instantly. Shestared at
								him. A hard, mean part of her wanted to hate him.
							</p>

							<p>
								My son would be Kip’s age. Hell, Kip could be my son. He does haveblue eyes, and my
								grandmother was Parian.
							</p>

							<p>
								What, you think brown skin and kinky hair skips a generation? Liketwins?
							</p>

							<p>
								Karris rubbed her face. It was an idle fantasy and she knew it. The sonshe’d abandoned
								was Kip’s half brother, but any similarities they sharedwould be because they shared
								Gavin as a father. And what a father he’dbeen, to both boys.
							</p>

							<p>
								She had to get out of here. She was thinking too much.Karris watched Kip sleep, seeing
								the Guile blood in the shape of hisbrow and his nose, and she couldn’t even name the
								feelings in her heart.
							</p>

							<p>
								Eventually, she covered him with her blanket.
							</p>

							<p>
								Chapter 77
							</p>

							<p>
								Gavin survived the noon rituals. The luxiat, a perfectly well-intentionedyoung green,
								was shaking like a leaf through the whole thing. Garristonwasn’t exactly a prime
								posting, so no doubt the young man hadn’t expectedto ever catch a glimpse of the Prism,
								much less meet him, much less beresponsible for performing the Sun Day ritual with him.
								They muddledthrough, Gavin prompting the young man with his lines two or three times.It
								took an hour and a half—and that was with Gavin cutting short the listbeseeching
								Orholam’s blessing on every noble in the Seven Satrapies andevery official in the
								Chromeria.“If even Orholam can’t remember their names, maybe they aren’t all
								thatimportant, eh?” he told the luxiat, leaving the young man gawping.
							</p>

							<p>
								It was early afternoon before he could escape. Escape being relative, ofcourse. He had a
								dozen Blackguards, a secretary, four messengers, and adozen city guards accompanying
								him. He went to the docks.
							</p>

							<p>
								He found Corvan there, ably directing the mess. The crowd wasn’t asbad as he had assumed
								it would be. Perhaps people were holding out hopethat Gavin would save them. Perhaps
								after seeing him build an impossiblewall, they thought his powers were unlimited.
								Perhaps some were simplyreligiously observant—only absolutely necessary work was
								supposed to bedone on this holiest of days.
							</p>

							<p>
								Good thing staying alive doesn’t count as absolutely necessary.Many nobles were
								bartering with ship captains. Boxes of goods werepiled on the docks—and plenty of goods
								that weren’t in boxes. Rolled-uptapestries that must have hung in families’ great halls,
								furniture with goldleaf paint, artwork, a maze of trunks packed with Orholam knew
								what.“Lord Prism,” General Danavis said, coming up to Gavin quickly.“Perfect timing.”
							</p>

							<p>
								Which means you’re about to hand over some truly unpleasant duty.“I gave the order
								yesterday that no ships were to leave the harbor, incase an evacuation became necessary.
								I let it be known that disobediencemeant seizure of the ship for the captain, and death
								for whoever hired him.”
							</p>

							<p>
								It was a harsh sentence, but war called for harsh sentences. Whoevertook a ship out of
								the city early was condemning dozens to death ifGarriston were overrun and a massacre
								began. The problem with harshsentences was that someone always tried to call your
								bluff—once. “Whowas it?” Gavin asked. He thought he knew already.“Governor Crassos. His
								men fired on the Blackguards who went to stopthem.”
							</p>

							<p>
								Blackguards? How’d Corvan get Blackguards to obey a “fetch me thatprisoner” order? “Any
								hurt?”“No, Lord Prism.”“He’s here?” Gavin asked. He needed to get out of here. His
								entouragewas blocking Corvan’s people from coming and going through the street asthey
								needed to, and they were blocking access to the docks as well. But thishe wouldn’t
								dodge. It was better to handle these things in a way thatreinforced the solemnity of the
								law, but it was best to handle them quicklybefore others disobeyed the same law and you
								ended up having to kill more.When the sands were running out of the glass, delayed
								justice was as bad asinjustice. “Bring the sailors too, and whatever cargo he was
								taking,” Gavintold Corvan quietly.
							</p>

							<p>
								Governor Crassos was, indeed, barely ten paces away. He’d just beensurrounded by guards
								much taller than he was, blocking him from sight. Hishands were bound behind his back
								and one eye was swelling. A motleycollection of smugglers were brought forward with him,
								scruffy, hard-edgedmen who’d taken on the job knowing the risks.
							</p>

							<p>
								Gavin raised both hands over his head, throwing out a small fan ofsparks. Anyone who
								hadn’t been looking before was now. “I herebyconvene this adjudication in the light of
								Orholam’s eye. Let justice bedone.”
							</p>

							<p>
								Heads bobbed all around the docks in acknowledgment of the suddenprayer. The accused
								were pushed roughly to their knees. Humility beforejustice.
							</p>

							<p>
								If I’m going to block the docks, I might as well accomplish somethingwhile I’m
								here.“Governor, you’re accused of hiring a ship to flee the city, against theorders of
								the general in charge. Is this true?”“General? I’m the governor of this shithole! No one
								tells me what todo!”“Not even I?” Gavin asked. “The general was acting in my name,
								givenexplicit authority to do so. Did you hire this crew to leave the city?”“You’ve got
								fifty witnesses who’ll tell you I did. So what? We helpedyou. My family stood by you in
								the war. You wouldn’t be here without us!”Governor Crassos’s voice trailed to a whine.
								“You’re going to put thesepeasants in front of me?”“Captain,” Gavin said, turning away
								from the governor, “youacknowledge your attempt to flee?”
							</p>

							<p>
								The captain looked around, defiant, unbroken, but not quite daring tomeet the Prism’s
								eye. Apparently everyone on the docks had seen theattempt. He had the air of a man who
								knew he was going to die and wantedto die well. He was holding his courage in a tight
								grip. “Yessir. The guvnorhired us last night. I already wanted out.” Of course he did.
								Every man witha ship wanted out, and wanted out yesterday.“It is an old tradition,”
								Gavin said loudly, for the assembled crowd, “togrant one pardon on Sun Day. As Orholam
								is merciful, so should we bemerciful.”“Oh, thank Orholam and his Prism among us,”
								Governor Crassos said,struggling to his feet. “You won’t regret this, Lord Prism.”
							</p>

							<p>
								Gavin drafted superviolet for its invisibility and smacked it across theback of
								Crassos’s knees, never even looking at him. The man dropped.Gavin addressed the captain.
								“Captain, by rights I should lock you in a celland leave you there to whatever fate
								might find you. Instead, I’m going torelease you, and I’m going to give you my ship—the
								ship you forfeited—and your crew. I’ll be watching you, Captain. Serve well.”
							</p>

							<p>
								The captain looked poleaxed. Then, embarrassingly, his eyes welledwith sudden
								tears.“What?!” Crassos demanded.“Governor Crassos, you have disobeyed my order and
								demeaned youroffice. A governor is to bear up his people, not weigh them down. You
								havestolen from the people Orholam gave you the duty to lead. You are a thiefand a
								coward. I hereby strip you of your governorship. You wanted to takeyour riches and
								leave? So be it.”
							</p>

							<p>
								Gavin selected a trunk from among those Crassos had taken with him. Itwas full of rich
								clothing, large, and so heavy that one man would havetrouble holding it. He shot large
								holes in the top, bottom, and sides. He gaveorders and guards put the trunk in Crassos’s
								arms and then bound it to himwith ropes.“You can’t do this,” Crassos said.“It’s done,”
								Gavin said. “Your only choice now is how you face it.”“My family will hear of this!”
								Crassos said.“Then let them hear you died like a man,” Gavin said.It was like Gavin had
								slapped the man across the face. His familyobviously meant everything to him.
							</p>

							<p>
								Gavin drafted a blue platform out into the water. “You wanted to flee,
							</p>

							<p>
								Lord Crassos? Go.”
							</p>

							<p>
								Without hesitation, Lord Crassos walked down the steps of blue luxinand out onto the
								water, carrying his trunk. He got out about fifteen pacesbefore the luxin cracked and he
								fell into the water. In moments, he waskicking to keep the buoyant chest from bobbing
								over his head and drowninghim.
							</p>

							<p>
								The tide was just turning, so he merely sloshed back and forth, neitherpushed in closer
								to shore nor washed out toward the other piers or towardthe Guardian and the open sea.
							</p>

							<p>
								A thousand pairs of eyes watched him, silently. In a minute, he wasn’thaving to kick so
								hard to keep the trunk from pushing him under—becausethe trunk wasn’t floating as high
								in the water. He was trying to staredefiantly toward the dock, toward Gavin, but his wet
								hair was falling infront of his eyes, and he couldn’t seem to shake his head enough to
								get itout of them.
							</p>

							<p>
								He screamed something right before he went under. Gavin couldn’tunderstand him. More
								death. He hadn’t liked Crassos, hated his attitude,hated the type of noble he
								represented, who took and took and neverthought to give a crumb back. But he’d just
								killed a man, made enemies ofhis family—and this in the midst of a war that would have
								done the job forhim.
							</p>

							<p>
								Gavin watched for the bubbles and didn’t see any. Crassos had floatedtoo far out. Gavin
								raised his hands, and then brought them in. “Orholamhave mercy,” he announced, bringing
								the adjudication to a close. He’dalready spent too much time here. He turned.
							</p>

							<p>
								Behind him in the bay, a shark’s fin cut the water like an arrow headedfor its target.
							</p>

							<p>
								Chapter 78
							</p>

							<p>
								At sunset, Gavin had finished the most public of the rituals of the day. Itwas a big
								show, and he did his best to make each one special. It was onepart of the day he could
								feel good about. He always performed nearlynaked. Colors bloomed and raced through his
								body, out of his body, andgave the appearance of going back into him.
							</p>

							<p>
								It hurt a little to use so much magic after yesterday’s fight, but it wasone thing he
								wouldn’t compromise.
							</p>

							<p>
								All too soon, however, it was over, and people were retiring to theirparties. The
								parties would go all night. Sun Day lasted until the next dawn.The parties of those to
								be Freed would begin at full dark. He was sitting in alittle chapel in the fortress. He
								had a few minutes, supposedly to pray.
							</p>

							<p>
								There was a time when he had used it to pray. No more. If Orholam wasreal, he was busy,
								he was asleep, he didn’t care, he was taking a shit. Timewas different to Orholam, they
								said. That would explain why he’d beendoing it for Gavin’s entire life.
							</p>

							<p>
								Gavin’s chest felt tight. He was having trouble breathing. The chapelseemed too small,
								too dark. He was sweating, cold, clammy sweat. Heclosed his eyes.
							</p>

							<p>
								Get some balls, Gavin. You can do this. You’ve done it before. This isfor them.
							</p>

							<p>
								It’s a lie. It’s all a lie.It’s better than the alternative. Breathe. This isn’t for
								you. You want togo out there and tell those drafters waiting for you that their entire
								lives area fraud? That their service is a waste? That Orholam doesn’t see
								theirsacrifice? That what they’ve done, what they’ve given, doesn’t matter?
							</p>

							<p>
								Everyone dies, Gavin, don’t rob it of meaning for these people. Don’t makethem see
								themselves as worthless. Their sacrifice as empty. All life asmeaningless.
							</p>

							<p>
								It was the same debate he had with himself every year. He’d evenbrought a bucket with
								him into the chapel, along with extra incense. Hethrew up, some years.
							</p>

							<p>
								There was a knock at the door of the chapel.“Lord Prism, it’s time.”
							</p>

							<p>
								Kip wasn’t blindfolded the next night. Instead, they gave him darkenedglasses, bound
								them around the back of his head, pulling them tight againsthis eyes, and ripped the
								sleeves off his shirt. It would be hard to draft, andanyone around him would have ample
								warning.“Apparently there’s something they want us to see,” Karris said as theguards,
								Mirrormen and drafters, hustled them out of the wagon they’d beensharing.
							</p>

							<p>
								They were brought to a security perimeter out away from the tents. Itwas oddly separate
								from the rest of the camp, given far too much room. Theperimeter itself was simply a
								rope strung between posts pounded quicklyinto the ground, but it was huge—and no one
								from the camp even cameclose to violating the circle. Inside, looking tiny compared to
								the size of thecircle, was a crowd gathered before a platform. The sun had fully set,
								but itwasn’t yet dark.“They don’t want to be overheard,” Karris said. “Tells you how
								crazythey are. They’re going to rally the troops with some idiocy any normwould mock
								outright.”
							</p>

							<p>
								Norm? Oh, a person who couldn’t draft. Wait, that meant…As they were walked closer, Kip
								saw that his inference was correct:every single person here was a drafter. There had to
								be eight hundred or athousand drafters here!“Orholam,” Karris breathed. “There must be
								five hundred drafters here.”So I can’t count, so what?But even Kip’s bravado melted away
								as they got closer. His and Karris’stenders pushed them into the crowd, and the first
								person they pushed out ofthe way stared at them with wild green eyes. His halos were
								cracked, snakesof green wriggling through the whites of his eyes.
							</p>

							<p>
								Kip felt like he was passing through a menagerie. It seemed almosteveryone light-skinned
								enough for it to show had skin stained by luxin.Green, blue, red, yellow, orange, even
								purple. When he looked into thesuperviolet, the superviolet drafters stood out like
								beacons. They’d workeddesigns into their cloaks, their armor, even their skin—all
								invisible toanyone but other superviolets. Adjusting his eyes, Kip saw that the
								sub-redshad done the same, etching dragons, phoenixes, whorls, and flames ontotheir
								clothes. Blues wore spikes curling like rams’ horns, or knife edgesalong their forearms.
								They passed an orange. The man looked normalexcept he’d slicked back his hair with
								orange luxin as if it were hair oil, andthe whites of his eyes were solid orange,
								leaving no differentiation fromwhite to iris, only the tiny black dots of his pupils
								marring that perfectcolor. A green clad only in leaves hissed at them; then she laughed.
								Amenagerie indeed, except Kip was in the cage with the animals.
							</p>

							<p>
								They were brought all the way to the front. The crowd was arrayed infront of a stone
								rising out of the ground, its surfaces worn smooth by windand rain, but tall enough to
								be a platform. As Kip and Karris arrived, a manclimbed up on the rock wearing a hooded
								cloak. He reached the top of thestone, threw back his hood, and tore off the cloak,
								throwing it aside as if itdisgusted him.
							</p>

							<p>
								The man’s entire body glowed in the gathering dark. He stood, defiant,silent, legs
								braced. He extended a hand toward the crowd, and at every fivepaces, in a wave, torches
								burst into flame, bathing them in light. Last,torches ringing his stone platform caught
								fire, and Kip saw that the manwas made entirely of luxin. And he was glowing from
								within.
							</p>

							<p>
								All around, drafters were dropping to their knees before Lord
							</p>

							<p>
								Omnichrome. But not all of them. Those who stood looked awkward,conflicted. For those
								who bowed weren’t just bowing, they were pressingtheir faces to the ground. This was
								pure religious devotion.“Don’t bow,” Karris said. “That’s no god.”“What is he?” Kip
								whispered.“My brother.”Lord Omnichrome extended his hands. “Please, no. Brothers,
								sisters,stand. Stand with me. We have fallen prostrate before men for far too long.”
							</p>

							<p>
								The orange drafter, the artist Aheyyad, fell prostrate before Gavin. He wasto be the
								first of the night. It was an honored place, and Aheyyad deservedhonor. Real honor, not
								this travesty. But there was no way out. There neverwas.
							</p>

							<p>
								Gavin stepped forward. “Stand, my child,” he said. Usually, when hecalled the drafters
								“my child” he felt sardonic. But Aheyyad was a child, orat least barely a man.
							</p>

							<p>
								Aheyyad stood. He met Gavin’s eyes, then quickly looked away.“You have something to
								say,” Gavin said. “This is the time.” Somedrafters felt the need to confess sins or
								secrets. Some made requests. Somejust wanted to express a frustration, a fear, a doubt.
								Depending on thenumber of drafters to be Freed before dawn, each year Gavin took as
								muchtime with each drafter as he could.“I failed you, Lord Prism,” Aheyyad said. “I
								failed my family. Theyalways said I was the son who could have been great. Instead, I’m
								a waste.An addict. I’m the gifted one who couldn’t handle Orholam’s gift.” Bittertears
								rolled down his cheeks. He still couldn’t look Gavin in the eye.“Look at me,” Gavin
								said. He took the young man’s face in his hands.“You joined me in the greatest work I
								have ever done. You did what I, thePrism, couldn’t do. Any man who has seen a sunset
								knows that Orholamvalues beauty. You made that wall as beautiful and terrible as
								Orholamhimself. What you did will stand for a thousand years.”“But we lost!”“We lost,”
								Gavin acknowledged. “My failure, not yours. Kingdomscome and go, but that wall will
								protect thousands yet unborn. And it willinspire hundreds of thousands more. I couldn’t
								have done that. Only youcould. You, Aheyyad, have made beauty. Orholam gave you a gift,
								and youhave given a gift to the world. That doesn’t sound like failure to me. Yourfamily
								will be proud. I am proud of you, Aheyyad. I will never forget you.You have inspired
								me.”
							</p>

							<p>
								A quick grin flickered over the young man’s face. “It is a pretty greatpiece, huh?”“Not
								bad for your first try,” Gavin said.Aheyyad laughed, his whole demeanor changed. He was
								a light indeed.
							</p>

							<p>
								A gift to the world, beautiful and so burning with life.“Are you ready, son?” Gavin
								asked.“Gavin Guile,” the young man said. “My Lord Prism. You, sir, are agreat man, and a
								great Prism. Thank you. I am ready.”“Aheyyad Brightwater, Orholam gave you a gift,”
								Gavin began. The lastname was the invention of the moment. In Paria, the only people
								given twonames were great men and women, and sometimes their children. From thesudden
								tears welling in Aheyyad’s eyes and the deep breath he took, hischest swelling with
								pride, Gavin knew he’d said the perfect thing. “And youhave stewarded well the gift he
								gave you. It is time to lay your burdendown, Aheyyad Brightwater. You gave the full
								measure. Your service willnot be forgotten, but your failures are hereby blotted out,
								forgotten, erased.Well done, true and faithful servant. You have fulfilled the
								Pact.”“They say we take a Pact! We make an oath! And with that oath, they bindus, they
								bury us,” Lord Omnichrome said.
							</p>

							<p>
								Liv was pushing carefully through the throng, moving toward the front.
							</p>

							<p>
								She swore she’d seen Kip led there, black spectacles bound to his head. Buteveryone else
								was paying rapt attention to the freak up front, so shecouldn’t move too quickly.
								Instead, she pretended to listen, too, and movedslowly.“Like this,” Lord Omnichrome
								said. He gestured to the rounded stoneon which he stood. “This is all that’s left of
								what was once a greatcivilization. You have seen these relics scattered throughout this
								land.Statues of great men, broken by the pygmies who followed.” Liv’s earsperked up.
								Rekton had had a broken statue, out in an orange grove. No onehad ever said anything
								about where it came from. She thought that wasbecause no one knew.“You think these
								statues are a mystery?” Lord Omnichrome asked.“They’re no mystery. You think it was a
								coincidence the Prisms’ War endedhere, in Tyrea? You think the Guiles simply wandered
								the Seven Satrapiesuntil their armies found each other? And it happened to be here? Let
								me tellyou something you already know, something that all of you have believedbut no one
								dared to say: the wrong Guile won the Prisms’ War. Dazen Guilewas trying to change
								things, and they killed him for it. The Chromeriakilled Dazen Guile. They killed him
								because they were worried he wouldchange everything. They feared him, because Dazen
								Guile wanted to Freeus.” There was some consternation in the crowd at that phrase. They
								allknew what day it was, and that the Prism was in Garriston, not even aleague away,
								performing the Freeing this very night.“You see?” Lord Omnichrome said. “You feel that
								uneasiness? Becausethe Chromeria has twisted our very language against us. Dazen wanted
								toFree us. Dazen knew that light cannot be chained.”“Light cannot be chained,” some of
								the drafters echoed. It was an almostreligious refrain.“The Freeing, they call it. Lay
								your burdens down, the Prism says. I giveyou absolution and freedom, he says. Do you
								know what he gives us? Doyou know?!”“I give you absolution,” Gavin said, his heart in
								his throat as Aheyyad kneltat his feet, eyes up, right hand on Gavin’s thigh. “I give
								you freedom.Orholam bless you and take you to his arms.” He drew his knife and buriedit
								in Aheyyad’s chest. Right in the heart. He withdrew the blade. A perfectthrust. But
								then, he’d had a lot of practice.
							</p>

							<p>
								He didn’t look at the wound, didn’t watch the blood bloom on
							</p>

							<p>
								Aheyyad’s shirt. He held the boy’s eyes as the life went out of them. Andwhen it did,
								Gavin said, “Please forgive me. Please forgive me.”
							</p>

							<p>
								Gavin had sheathed the dagger, and he was scrubbing his hands on theblood rag he
								carried—though they were clean. He stopped.“They murder you!” Lord Omnichrome shouted.
								“They stick a knife in youand watch you die. As you beg, they watch—and they say their
								god smileson this! Tell me, is this any way to treat our elders? Under the Chromeria,we
								barely have elders. They’ve killed them all. Oh, except for the White.Except for Andross
								Guile and his wife. The rules don’t apply to them, butyou and me, and our mothers and
								our fathers—we should be killed. Theysay this is Orholam’s will. They say it is the
								Pact. Like something we sworeto as ignorant children makes their murder of our parents
								good and right.What insanity is this? A woman serves the Seven Satrapies for all her
								life,and then as a reward, she’s murdered? Is this freedom? This is what theycall
								‘Freeing’ her?”
							</p>

							<p>
								Liv caught sight of Kip, but she wasn’t pushing toward him anymore.“You know it’s wrong.
								I know it’s wrong. They know it’s wrong. That’swhy they speak about it in hushed tones
								and euphemisms. It’s not just. It’snot a Freeing, it’s a murder, let’s be clear about
								that. And then they don’teven have the decency to give your body back to your family.
								They use it insome dark ritual instead. Is that what our fathers served so long to get?
								Isthat just? The Chromeria soils everything it touches. And do you think thatall who are
								‘Freed’ have volunteered?”
							</p>

							<p>
								Lord Omnichrome laughed derisively.
							</p>

							<p>
								As the Blackguards took Aheyyad’s body out of the room, careful not tospill any blood,
								there was a single knock on the door. One strike, followedby nothing. It took Gavin a
								moment to remember: Bas the Simple had neverreally understood knocking.“Come in, Bas,”
								Gavin said. Children and idiots. This is who I kill? Ibathe in the blood of innocents.
							</p>

							<p>
								The man came in. He was actually quite handsome dressed in his finery.
							</p>

							<p>
								Unlike other simpletons Gavin had known, there was no sign of Bas’sdifference in his
								facial features.“I am sorry for coming out of turn, Lord Prism. I have a question, and
								Idid not wish to interrupt my Freeing to ask it.”
							</p>

							<p>
								That he was interrupting someone else’s Freeing to ask the questiondidn’t occur to him,
								of course.“Please, ask,” Gavin said.“I heard Evi Grass talking about Brightwater Wall.
								Evi is a green/yellowbichrome. She’s from the Blood Forest, but I don’t think she’s
								scary at all.My mother used to tell me that anyone with red hair is just as like to set
								youon fire as look at you, but Evi isn’t like that.”
							</p>

							<p>
								Gavin knew Evi well. Not classically bright, she was incredibly intuitivebut rarely
								trusted herself. At least she hadn’t years ago.“Evi once saved me from a charging—”“What
								did she say, Bas?” Gavin asked.“She didn’t say anything, she just saved me. I guess she
								might haveyelled. I couldn’t tell you for sure—”“What did Evi say about Brightwater
								Wall?”“I don’t like it when you interrupt, Lord Prism. It makes me nervous.”Gavin
								stifled his impatience. Pushing harder would make Bascompletely incapable of speech.
							</p>

							<p>
								Bas saw that Gavin wasn’t going to push and then thought for amoment. Gavin could see
								him find the mental path once more. “Evi said thebrightwater was drafted perfectly. She
								said she didn’t remember you being asuperchromat. I can’t see the color differentiations
								myself, of course, but Idon’t think she’d lie, and Gavin Guile wasn’t a superchromat.
								His brotherDazen was. And you’re taller than Gavin. He wore boots to make himselflook
								taller, but Dazen was taller by his thirteenth birthday. I remember thatday. It was
								sunny. My grandmother said that Orholam had always smiled onthe Guiles. I was wearing my
								blue coat…”
							</p>

							<p>
								Gavin wasn’t listening. He felt like the floor had dropped out from underhis feet. He’d
								known this moment was coming. He’d expected it for sixteenyears. He’d gone into his
								first meetings as Gavin expecting anyone,everyone, to point and scream, “Impostor!
								Counterfeit!” Others had figuredit out, but never in a way he couldn’t contain. He
								couldn’t discredit Bas.The man was immune to political currents, and everyone knew it.
								And ifasked, Bas would point out a hundred differences between Gavin andDazen. By the
								time he was done speaking, the Gavin mask would bedestroyed.
							</p>

							<p>
								And yet he’d come alone. On this night, of all nights.“So my question was… my question
								was, why are you lying, Dazen?
							</p>

							<p>
								Why are you pretending to be Gavin? Dazen is bad. He kills people. Hekilled the White
								Oaks. All of them. They say he went from room to room intheir mansion, even killing the
								servants, and then he burned it all down tohide his crimes. The children were trapped in
								the basement. They foundtheir little bodies in a pile. They were hugging each other. I
								went there. Isaw them.” Bas stopped speaking, evidently consumed by that old image.With
								his perfect memory, it must have been vivid indeed. “I told those littlecharred bodies
								that I would kill Dazen Guile,” Bas said.
							</p>

							<p>
								Gavin felt an old dread, like the sting of an old master’s lash. Bas was
								agreen/blue/superviolet polychrome. Every drafter was changed over time byhis colors.
								Only the wildness of green would make the formerly order-obsessed Bas skip his place in
								line. But the orderliness of blue was makinghim crazy to know why, to see how things fit
								together. “Bas, I’m going totell you something I’ve only told one other person in the
								world. I’m goingto answer your question. You deserve it.” He lowered his voice. “When
								Iwas sixteen years old, I had a… a vision. A waking dream. I was in front ofa presence.
								I fell on my face. I knew he was holy, and I was afraid—”“Orholam himself?” Bas asked.
								He looked doubtful. “My mother toldme that people who say they speak for Orholam are
								usually lying. AndDazen is a liar!” His voice pitched up at the end.
							</p>

							<p>
								The last thing Gavin needed was Bas shouting something about Dazen.“Do you want to hear
								my answer or not?” he asked sharply.
							</p>

							<p>
								Bas hesitated. “Yes, but don’t you—”Gavin stabbed him in the heart.Bas’s eyes went wide.
								He grabbed Gavin’s arms. Gavin withdrew thedagger.
							</p>

							<p>
								Coldly, so coldly, Gavin said, “You gave the full measure, Bas. Yourservice will not be
								forgotten. Your failures are forgotten, erased. I give youabsolution. I give you
								freedom.”
							</p>

							<p>
								By the time he said “absolution,” Bas was dead.Gavin lowered the man to the floor
								carefully. He went and knocked atthe side door. The Blackguards came in and took the
								body, and just likethat, Gavin got away with murder.
							</p>

							<p>
								Chapter 79
							</p>

							<p>
								The man was a liar. Kip didn’t know exactly what was lie and what wastruth, but Lord
								Omnichrome was King Garadul’s right hand. They’dmassacred his village. For nothing. If
								murder was nothing to them, whatwas a lie?
							</p>

							<p>
								But there was truth here, like all the best lies. That really was what the
							</p>

							<p>
								Pact meant. No wonder they talked about it in sidelong conversations,hushed tones. You
								got old, you broke your halo, you became like a maddog. They had to put you down. Kip
								remembered when Corvan’s dog hadbeen bitten by a raccoon and later started foaming at
								the mouth. Corvan, thealcaldesa, and some of the other men loaded muskets and went after
								it.Corvan himself blew its brains out. He hid his face afterward, and everyonepretended
								not to see his tears. It had been a year before he talked about thatdog, but when he
								did, it was never of its madness, never of killing his dog.This was the same. No one
								talked about the Freeing because no one wantedto dishonor the dead: “Kip was a great
								man, right until he went crazy andstarted trying to kill his friends. Right until we had
								to put him down.”
							</p>

							<p>
								So it was a hard truth. That didn’t make it a lie. Indeed, it probably madeit more
								likely that it was true.
							</p>

							<p>
								But no one in this crowd wanted to accept that. They wanted someone toblame for the
								death of their parents. They didn’t want to die themselves.They could dress that up in
								some holy-sounding bullshit, but Kip had seenbehind the veil. These people were
								murderers. Gavin was a good man. Agreat man, a giant among dwarfs. So he had to do hard
								things. Great menmade the hard choices, so everyone could survive. So he held people to
								thePact, so what? Everyone swore to it. Everyone knew what they wereswearing. There was
								no mystery, no con. They made a deal, and they likedthe deal until they had to pay the
								price.
							</p>

							<p>
								These people were cowards, oathbreakers, scum.I have got to get out of here.He turned
								and saw the last woman he expected to see here.“Ilytian water clocks claim this is the
								shortest night of the year,” Felia Guilesaid from the doorway. “But it’s always been the
								longest for you.”
							</p>

							<p>
								Gavin looked up at her, gray-faced. “I didn’t expect you until dawn.”She smiled. “There
								was some disturbance with the order. Bas the Simplecut in earlier than he was supposed
								to. Some withdrew until later.” Sheshrugged.
							</p>

							<p>
								Withdrew? So maybe they know. It’s all falling apart.Maybe it’s best this way. I kill my
								own mother now, and she doesn’thave to see it all come crashing down.“Son,” she said.
								“Dazen.” The word was almost a sigh, a release of pent-up pressure. Truth, spoken aloud
								after years of lies.“Mother.” It was good to see her happy, but terrible to see her
								here. “Ican’t—I didn’t even take you on that flight I promised you.”“You really can
								fly?”He nodded, his throat tight.“My son can fly.” Her smile lit her face. “Dazen, I am
								so proud of you.”Gavin tried to speak, but failed.Her eyes were gentle. “I’ll help you,”
								she said. She knelt at the rail,opting for more formality. With his mother, Gavin should
								have known.“Lord Prism, I have sins to confess. Will you shrive me?”
							</p>

							<p>
								Gavin blinked back sudden tears, mastered himself. “Gladly…daughter.”

							<p>
								Her attitude of simple piety helped him play his part. He was not herson, not here and
								now. He was her spiritual father, a link to Orholam on theholiest day of her life.“Lord
								Prism, I married unwisely and lived fearfully. I let myself beowned by my fear that my
								husband would put me aside, and didn’t speakwhen I knew I should. I let my sons be
								pitted against each other, and one isdead because of it. Their father didn’t foresee it
								because he was a fool, but Iknew.”“Mother,” Gavin interjected.“Daughter,” she corrected
								firmly.Gavin paused. Acquiesced. “Daughter, go on.”“I have spoken cruel words. I have
								lied a thousand times. I have treatedmy slaves without regard to their welfare…” She
								spoke for five minutes,not sparing herself, blunt and forthright, not condensing her
								answers for hersake, but for Gavin’s—he had others to shrive this night. It was surreal.
							</p>

							<p>
								Gavin had heard stunning admissions and seen darker sides of peoplewith saintly
								reputations for the last sixteen years, but hearing her confessbeating an innocent slave
								in her rage minutes after finding Andross in bedwith another woman was heartrending.
								Dislocating. To hear his motherconfess was like seeing her naked.“And I have killed,
								thrice. For my son. I lost two boys; I couldn’t bear tolose my last,” she said. Gavin
								could hardly believe her. “Once I got aBlackguard who suspected him reassigned to a
								dangerous post during theRed Cliff Uprising, where I knew he would be killed. Once I
								directedpirates to the ship Dervani Malargos was taking home after having been lostin
								the wilds of Tyrea for years. He claimed to have been closest to theconflagration at
								Sundered Rock and to have seen things no one else had. Itried to buy him off, but he
								slipped away. And once I hired an assassinduring the Thorn Conspiracies, using the cover
								of someone else’s fight tomurder someone who was about to blackmail my son.”
							</p>

							<p>
								Gavin was speechless. In the first year of his masquerade, he’d killedthree men to
								protect his identity and exiled a dozen more. Then two in theseventh year. He hadn’t
								killed anyone in cold blood since—until Bas. He’dknown his mother had protected him, but
								he’d always thought she’d done itby passing on information she learned. His mother had
								always been fiercelyprotective, but he’d never imagined how far she would go. How far
								hewould force her to go because he’d supplanted Dazen.
							</p>

							<p>
								Dear Orholam, how I wish I believed in you, that you might forgive mefor what I’ve
								done.“Each time,” she said, “I told myself I was serving Orholam and the
							</p>

							<p>
								Seven Satrapies, and not just my family. But my conscience has never beenclear.”
							</p>

							<p>
								Shaken, he intoned the traditional words, offering her forgiveness.She stood, looking at
								him intently. “Now, son, there are a few things youshould know before I lay my burdens
								down.” She didn’t wait for him to sayanything, which was good, because he didn’t think
								he was capable of it.“You are not the evil son, Dazen. You were errant, but never
								mean-spirited. You are a true Prism—”“Errant? I murdered the White Oaks! I—”“Did you?”
								she interrupted, sharp. Then, softer, “I’ve seen that poisoneating you for sixteen
								years. And always you’ve refused to talk. Tell mewhat happened.” His mother really was a
								Guile, if not by blood, bytemperament. She’d wanted to talk about this all along.“I
								can’t.”“If not me, who? If not now, when? Dazen, I’m your mother. Let megive you this.”
							</p>

							<p>
								His tongue felt like lead, but the images were there before his eyes in aninstant. The
								leering faces of the White Oak brothers, the surge of fearparalyzing him. Gavin licked
								his lips, but he couldn’t force the first wordsout. He felt the hatred once more, fury
								at the injustice. Seven on one, more.The lies. “Things were already bad with Gavin. Blue
								and green awoke forme early, but I was starting to suspect I could do more. I told him.
								Youknow, we hadn’t been close since he’d been announced Prism-elect, andsomehow
								Sevastian’s murder only made things worse. I guess I thoughttelling him my gifts were
								growing would bring him back. Like we could bebest friends again. But he didn’t like it.
								Not at all.” From nowhere, a washof tears came to Gavin’s eyes. He missed his brother so
								much it tore hissoul. “I understand now how threatening it must have been for a young
								manto lose the one thing that made him special. I didn’t, then. The day after Itold him
								I was a polychrome, I heard him urging father to betroth him toKarris. It was the
								greatest betrayal I could imagine. Her love was the onething that made me special. It
								was some time before I saw the symmetry tothat.“Anyway, I thought Karris was as in love
								with me as I was with her.
							</p>

							<p>
								When father announced her betrothal to Gavin, we decided to run awaytogether. She must
								have told someone. Maybe it was an accident. MaybeGavin seemed a better prize. Karris
								and I were supposed to meet justoutside her family’s mansion after midnight. She wasn’t
								there. Her maidtold me she was inside. It was a trap, of course. The White Oak
								brothersknew I’d been trysting with Karris, and they wanted to teach me a lesson.Said
								I’d dishonored them, turned their sister into a whore.”
							</p>

							<p>
								They’d grabbed him as soon as he stepped inside. All seven brothers.
							</p>

							<p>
								They’d torn off his cloak and snatched away his spectacles and his sword.He remembered
								the great, enclosed courtyard, servants peeking out fromdoors and windows. There was a
								great bonfire in the courtyard—plenty oflight, but none for a blue/green bichrome
								without spectacles. “They startedbeating me. They’d been drinking. Several were drafting
								red. It got out ofhand. I thought—still think—that they were going to kill me. I got
								awayonce, but the gate I tried was chained shut.”“They chained the gates?” Felia Guile
								asked. It had become part of thestory that Dazen had done that. Out of cruelty. Karris’s
								father had knownbetter, but had said nothing to combat the lie.“They didn’t want me to
								get out or any guards or soldiers from theoutside to be able to get in to interfere
								before they were done.” Gavin gotquiet. Glanced at his mother. Her face was all
								tenderness. He looked away.“I split light for the first time that night. It felt…
								wonderful. I’d thought
							</p>

							<p>
								I might be a superviolet to yellow polychrome, but that night, I used red. Alot of red.
								Maybe I wasn’t ready for what red does to you when you’realready furious.” He remembered
								the shock on their faces when he starteddrafting. They knew he was a blue/green. They
								knew what he was doingwas impossible. There was only one Prism each generation. Images
								offireballs streaking from his bleeding hands, of Kolos White Oak’s skullsmoking while
								he still stood, of the White Oak guards slaughtered by thedozen, limbs sheared off,
								blood everywhere. “I killed the brothers and allthe White Oak guards. The fires were
								spreading. The front gate collapsed asI got out. I heard people screaming.” He’d gone,
								staggering, left empty andnumb, to find his horse.“There was a maid at the side door.
								The woman who’d lured me into thetrap. She looked through the bars and begged me to open
								it. It was the samedoor I’d tried when I was trying to get out. It was chained on the
								inside, butshe didn’t have the key. I told her to burn, and I left. I didn’t
								realize—Ididn’t even think that all the other doors were chained too. I just wanted
								toget away. They couldn’t find the keys in time, I guess. With that casualcruelty, I
								consigned a hundred innocents to death.” Like it was better for theguilty to die than
								for the innocent to live.
							</p>

							<p>
								Funny thing, he could weep about not being friends with his brother, buthe had nothing
								inside himself for all those dead innocents. Slaves andservants bound to the White Oaks
								not by choice. Children. It was just toomonstrous.
							</p>

							<p>
								And most of the men who’d joined Dazen in the war later hadn’t evenasked what had
								happened that night. They’d been happy to fight for a manwhom they thought had killed an
								entire mansion full of people—because itmeant he was indestructible. How he despised
								them.
							</p>

							<p>
								His mother came and held him. And now, silently, he wept. Perhaps forthose dead. Perhaps
								only selfishly, because he was losing her.“Dazen, it isn’t mine to absolve you of what
								happened that night, or ofall that happens in war that you carry still. But I do forgive
								you of all that Ican. You are no monster. You are a true Prism, and I love you.”
								Shetrembled, tears streaking down her cheeks, but she glowed. She kissedGavin on the
								lips, something she hadn’t done since he was a boy. “I’mproud of you, Dazen. Proud to be
								your mother,” she said. “Sevastian wouldbe proud of you too.”
							</p>

							<p>
								He held her, weeping. There was no absolution for him. Sevastian wasstill dead, and her
								other son rotted in a hell Gavin had created for him. Shewouldn’t have forgiven that.
								But he wept and she held him, soothing himlike a child once more.
							</p>

							<p>
								Then, all too soon, she pushed him back. “It’s time,” she said. She tooka deep breath.
								“Is it… is it acceptable for me to draft one last time? It’s beenyears.”“Absolutely,”
								Gavin said, trying to put himself back together. Hegestured to the orange panel of the
								wall.
							</p>

							<p>
								She drew in orange luxin. Shivered. Sighed. “It feels like life, doesn’tit?” She knelt
								gracefully. “Remember what I said,” she said.“Everything,” he swore. Even if I don’t
								believe it.“It’s all right,” she said. “You’ll believe it someday.”He blinked.Felia
								Guile chuckled. “You don’t get all your smarts from your father,you know.”“I never
								doubted it.”She drew her hair back over her shoulders to give him a clear path to
								herheart. She placed her hand on his thigh, looked up at him. She let the orangeluxin
								go. “I’m ready,” she said.“I love you,” Gavin said. He took a deep breath. “Felia Guile,
								you gavethe full measure. Your service will not be forgotten, but your failures
								arehereby blotted out, forgotten, erased. I give you absolution. I give youfreedom. Well
								done, good and faithful servant.”
							</p>

							<p>
								He stabbed her in the heart. Then he held her, kneeling with her, kissingher face as she
								died. It was several long minutes before he had the strengthto stand and summon the
								Blackguards.
							</p>

							<p>
								When they opened the door, he saw that there were a hundred drafters inthe hall, waiting
								for him. They weren’t smiling. The enormous Usef Tep,the Purple Bear, stepped forward.
								“We didn’t want to cause a disturbancewhile you were with your mother, but sir, we need
								to talk.”
							</p>

							<p>
								Sir. Not Lord Prism. Not Gavin.So begins the end.
							</p>

							<p>
								Chapter 80“Kip, whatever happens, stay close to me,” Karris whispered, leaning close.
							</p>

							<p>
								She said it with a tension and certainty that told Kip something wasgoing to happen.
								Soon. Though he wanted to, he didn’t ask. Their guardswere close, though everyone’s
								attention was focused on Lord Rainbow upfront and his verbal feces about duty and
								justice. Kip had long ago stoppedpaying attention. He was staring at a girl, not ten
								paces away. Liv.
							</p>

							<p>
								He could have sworn she’d been pushing closer to him and Karris for awhile, but for the
								last ten minutes she’d stood as though frozen, listening toLord Rainbow. The crowd
								between them moved, and he saw that she waswearing yellow cloth vambraces. Liv was a
								yellow. It had to be her.
							</p>

							<p>
								Kip craned his head around, looking toward Brightwater Wall.“Stop acting suspicious,”
								Karris said through gritted teeth. Which left
							</p>

							<p>
								Kip with absolutely zero places to look. If he stared at Liv, that would drawattention
								to her, the speech disgusted him, he couldn’t look at the wall, andwhen he looked at
								Karris, he couldn’t help but notice her dress. Karris hadbeen thought-freezingly
								gorgeous when Kip had seen her wrapped in aheavy black cloak over her Blackguard garb.
								In the thin black dress she waswearing, her beauty ripped Kip’s breath out of his chest,
								stomped on it, andset it on fire. She stood straight, imperious, regal, elegance
								personified. Noone had given her a shawl despite the coolness of the night. In the
								risinglight, Kip could see the gooseflesh on her arms.“Cold out, huh?” he said.One of
								their guards snorted.“I will beat you to death if you ask for it,” Karris said, still
								staringstraight ahead.
							</p>

							<p>
								Kip had no idea what she was talking about, or why the guard waslaughing. “What did—” He
								looked down at her chest. Her nipples wereclearly defined against the thin silk. Kip
								gaped just as she looked over andcaught him looking.“Kip. Dark spectacles are not a
								license to ogle.”Will the earth please open and swallow me now? She thought he’d
								beenbeing snarky about… Oh, Orholam. He was the stupidest boy in history.
							</p>

							<p>
								The speech ended without anything special happening. Kip glancedcarefully at Karris. She
								looked toward the east, where the sky waslightening.“He’s waiting until it’s almost
								dawn,” Karris whispered, as their guardspushed them to start walking. “Be ready.”“He?”
								Kip asked.“Shut it!” the Mirrorman to Kip’s left said. He smacked Kip with thebutt of
								his musket.
							</p>

							<p>
								Oh, I can make inappropriate jokes on accident, but you’ve got aproblem when I’m just
								trying to escape?
							</p>

							<p>
								At first, Kip couldn’t see very well where they were going through thevast crowd.
								Gradually, though, he saw that the drafters were joining a muchlarger group that was
								being addressed by King Garadul.
							</p>

							<p>
								Kip lost sight of Liv quickly. The dark spectacles he was wearing madehim almost blind.
								He could see out of the sides if he strained, but it made itimpossible to search the
								crowd. With his hands tied behind his back, therewas no way to fix that either.
							</p>

							<p>
								Tens of thousands of soldiers surrounded King Garadul. The man waswaving his arms,
								shouting, but Kip could only hear snippets as the draftersjoined the outskirts of that
								group: “cleanse this city… Take back what hasbeen stolen from us… punish…” It sounded
								pretty grim.
							</p>

							<p>
								Again, Kip seemed to be the only person who wasn’t hanging on everyword, so as the sun
								rose, first touching Brightwater Wall behind thembecause it was higher than the plain
								below, he saw movement on the wall.
							</p>

							<p>
								He couldn’t see it well around the frame of the spectacles, but the formsof five men—a
								cannon crew—became three, then in a violent motion two,then just one. The cannon on the
								wall had been pointed at a high trajectorytoward Garriston, but the man was angling it
								down and down.
							</p>

							<p>
								A quick spark.Boom!
							</p>

							<p>
								The cannon spat fire. Kip didn’t see the shell hit, but he felt it. The earthseemed to
								jump.
							</p>

							<p>
								For a moment, no one did anything, thinking it must have been amistake. Screams of
								fright and pain. Then Karris collided with him,knocking him off his feet.
							</p>

							<p>
								Kip smacked his head as he fell, so at first he wasn’t sure if the secondexplosion was
								just his imagination.“Canister shot!” Karris said. “Shit! We have to move! Ironfist’s
								aimingfor that wagon.”
							</p>

							<p>
								Wagon? Ironfist? Why was Ironfist shooting at them?Kip was blinking. Something was
								strange about his vision—oh!
							</p>

							<p>
								Smacking his head against the ground had knocked one of the black lensesout of the frame
								of his spectacles.“Grab that lens and cut my hands free!” Karris barked.They were both
								lying on the ground, hands bound. The crackle ofmusket fire filled the air.
							</p>

							<p>
								One of the Mirrorman guards grabbed Kip, trying to haul him to his feet.Despite lying
								flat on her back, Karris kicked the back of the man’s kneewith her left foot. He folded,
								and by the time he landed on his back her rightfoot had swept up and then down in an ax
								kick across his throat. There wasa crunch and blood sprayed through the mail flap over
								the man’s mouth.
							</p>

							<p>
								Kip could hardly believe what he’d just seen, but Karris was alreadymoving on. She
								scrambled over the dying man, lying right on top of him.With her hands still behind her
								back, she drew the man’s belt knife a hand’sbreadth and cut her wrists free.“Stop!” a
								Mirrorman yelled, his musket pointed at Karris’s head.There was still screaming
								everywhere. Chaos. Shouting and gunfire andthe screams of the dying.
							</p>

							<p>
								Kip lashed out, kicking for the Mirrorman’s knee as Karris had doneseconds before.
							</p>

							<p>
								The Mirrorman saw it coming and swung the butt of his musket for
							</p>

							<p>
								Kip’s leg——and was flung away like Orholam’s own hand had slapped him.A concussion, a
								roar, a pressure so vast Kip’s vision went black for aninstant. Everyone standing was
								torn off their feet. Things—Kip couldn’teven tell what they were—blasted overhead.
							</p>

							<p>
								He must have lost a few seconds. He rolled over, tried to stand, fell. Hiswrists were
								bloody, but no longer bound. The acrid aroma of gunpowderfilled the air. Bits of wood
								rained down on the ground.
							</p>

							<p>
								When Kip tried to stand again, someone helped him. Not even a hundredpaces away where
								the powder wagon had been, he saw a crater in theground a good ten paces across and at
								least two paces deep. Everyone in ahuge circle around it was dead.
							</p>

							<p>
								Karris turned him around, her mouth moving, skin smudged withpowder. He couldn’t hear
								her.
							</p>

							<p>
								He saw her mouth a curse as she realized the same thing. He was prettysure she was
								mouthing “Ironfist” and a series of curses. She put a musket inhis hands and said,
								slowly enough that Kip could read her lips, “Can youwalk?”
							</p>

							<p>
								Kip nodded, not sure how much he was hearing her and how much hewas reading her lips.
								She pulled at him and they started jogging. He wasstill disoriented, but he saw that he
								wasn’t the only one. Dozens of men andwomen with powder-darkened skin and clothes were
								staggering around,some of them bleeding from their ears. A man was carrying his left
								hand inhis right hand, looking for the rest of his arm as blood pumped out of hismangled
								shoulder.
							</p>

							<p>
								Teams of soldiers were forming up now and running toward the wall.
							</p>

							<p>
								Others stood back and were firing their muskets at the gun emplacement,but Kip didn’t
								see anyone on top of the wall returning fire.
							</p>

							<p>
								Someone was shouting at Kip. Good, so he could hear. He turned.He didn’t recognize the
								soldier standing in front of him. “Form up,soldier!” the man shouted. “Move it!”
							</p>

							<p>
								They thought he was a soldier because he had a musket. But then, withhis
								powder-blackened clothes, it was no wonder.“Come on, soldier, we’ve got a city to
								take!”There were at least twenty soldiers with the man, and only the officerhad a real
								uniform. Kip shot a glance at Karris. She was wobbling back andforth, holding her hands
								over her eyes like she was blind, just anotherwounded person. Kip realized that if they
								saw the violet caps over her eyes,they’d capture her immediately. Or kill her outright.
								With that dress, it wasbest not to let their attention alight on her any longer than
								necessary.
							</p>

							<p>
								If Kip refused, the man could summarily execute him. And he lookedgrim, ready to do it.
								“Yes, sir!” Kip said. He joined the lines, glanced at
							</p>

							<p>
								Karris, looked once more for Liv and didn’t see her, and then ran with thesoldiers
								toward the city and the sound of guns and the flash of magic.
							</p>

							<p>
								Chapter 81
							</p>

							<p>
								Gavin squared his shoulders and confronted his accusers. A hallway in theTravertine
								Palace. It wasn’t exactly where he would have picked to die, buthe supposed it was
								better than some dungeon somewhere. Better than I gaveyou, Gavin. At least he could face
								this with dignity.“What do you want?” he demanded.“We know what you’re doing,” Usef Tep
								said. “Sir.” The “sir” wasbelated. It always was with the Purple Bear.
							</p>

							<p>
								Samila Sayeh came forward, put a hand on Usef’s meaty arm. “We’vecome together to stop
								you, Gavin Guile.”“And how do you propose to do that?” Gavin asked.“By
								volunteering.”Huh? Gavin tottered on the edge of drafting everything he could.
							</p>

							<p>
								Stopped. Tried to keep his idiot perplexity off his face.“It’s noble, Lord Prism, but
								it’s not wise.”What? Well sometimes when you don’t know what the hell someone’stalking
								about, the best thing to do is play along.“I don’t know what the hell you’re talking
								about,” Gavin said. Oops.“The Freeing is the holiest moment in a drafter’s life,” Samila
								said.“You’re trying to protect that for us. And we thank you for that. But
								we’rewarriors. All of us fought in the war. We’re willing to fight again.”“I die this
								day,” Usef said. “It’s my duty to make an end, and I acceptthat. But I’ve got no
								patience for all this Orholam this and Orholam that. I’drather go down fighting.”“Lord
								Prism,” Samila Sayeh said, “we have to hold the city long enoughfor everyone to escape.
								Holding the walls is a death sentence. Why not giveit to us? We’re dead anyway.”
							</p>

							<p>
								Their talking had given Gavin a few moments to think, to recover hisbalance. “If I send
								you out there, you’ll all break the halo. That’s whyyou’re here. Next year I’ll have to
								face you fighting for him. They don’t putdown color wights. It’s not just your souls
								we’re talking about here. It’syour sanity. And you’re right, you’re all warriors. That
								makes you ten timesas dangerous when you break.”“We’ll fight in teams. Each with a
								pistol and a knife. When we break,we’ll do as the Blackguards do.”
							</p>

							<p>
								When a comrade broke the halo on the battlefield, the Blackguardsconsidered them
								dead—and indeed, it did usually render a personunconscious temporarily. The Blackguards
								would check the eyes of a fallencomrade, and if the halo was broken, they’d slit their
								throat.“Except when a team’s down to one, we end ourselves too,” Samila said.
							</p>

							<p>
								It was, for some, a thorny theological point, though not without precedent.Was suicide a
								sin when you knew you were going mad and would likelyhurt or kill innocents? “You are
								the Prism, you could make a specialdispensation.”“Future generations would believe that
								implied special dispensation isneeded,” Talon Gim said, scowling. He had always had very
								definitetheological views.
							</p>

							<p>
								Maros Orlos stepped forward. “Lord Prism, we’ve already sent to be
							</p>

							<p>
								Freed all the drafters we knew were too far gone to be any use on thebattlefield. What
								is the greater good here? That we do things as they’vealways been done, or that we save
								an entire city?”
							</p>

							<p>
								There was no contest, of course. Gavin was trembling. “I think such asacrifice would
								honor Orholam. I will give each of you a… special blessingas you take up this burden. I
								am… deeply humbled by this act of devotion.Deeply grateful.”
							</p>

							<p>
								That much was no lie.After making the decision to let the Freeing class fight to the
								deathinstead of be Freed on his knife, Gavin still met with each of them. Heshrived
								them, listened to their concerns about dying, and blessed them. Itwas exactly the same
								as he would have done otherwise—minus the killing.But to Gavin, it was entirely
								different. Usually, he was so sickened by whathe had to do that he couldn’t give their
								words his full attention. He tried. Hepretended. He knew they deserved his best.
							</p>

							<p>
								But today, he did it. They weren’t really talking to him as they spoke;they were talking
								to Orholam. Gavin was simply an instrument to maketheir confessions easier than
								addressing an empty room. What they weredoing was an act of devotion. It was an act of
								sacrifice.
							</p>

							<p>
								To others, it wouldn’t seem that different than what some did every yearat the Freeing.
								It would end with a dead drafter who’d gone to deathbravely. But without the burden of
								shedding their blood, Gavin was able tosee it clearly for the first time. These people
								were heroes.
							</p>

							<p>
								If Gavin hadn’t pulled one over on the whole world and on Orholamhimself by masquerading
								as his own brother, perhaps the Freeing wouldhave seemed this holy every year. It was
								supposed to be something tocelebrate, but Gavin had dreaded it. Always.
							</p>

							<p>
								Now, as he prayed with each drafter, he could almost believe Orholamlistened.
							</p>

							<p>
								Samila Sayeh was the last. She was, Gavin was reminded, a womanwhose beauty withstood
								scrutiny. Her skin, even in her forties, was nearlyflawless. A few smile lines, but
								clear and glowing. Slim. Stunning blue eyesagainst Atashian olive skin. Impeccably
								dressed.“I had an affair with your brother, you know,” she said.Gavin froze. He knew
								that he, Dazen, had not had an affair with Samila
							</p>

							<p>
								Sayeh—which could only mean one thing: she knew. “Sometimes a manlikes to pretend that
								nothing has happened between him and an old lover,”Gavin said quickly. “Especially when
								it was a great mistake.”
							</p>

							<p>
								She laughed. “I’ve wondered often over the years, are you just so goodthat you’ve never
								been discovered, or does everyone who could expose youhave an ulterior motive for not
								doing so?” She stared at him, but he saidnothing. “You know, Evi was looking at your
								wall. She said, ‘I don’tremember Gavin being a superchromat. He shouldn’t be able to
								craft ayellow this perfect.’ And do you know what she said after that? She saidthat
								Orholam must have blessed your effort. That it was proof you weredoing his will. And
								everyone nodded their heads. Can you believe it?”
							</p>

							<p>
								Gavin felt a chill.“Gavin would have made a wall that would last a month and bragged
								itwould last forever. You made a wall that will last forever, and said it mightlast a
								few years. You just couldn’t stand to make an inferior product, couldyou, Dazen?”
								Someone who’d been drafting blue for twenty-five yearswould be pleased to see the order
								in this: Dazen was a perfectionist, so eventhough he could make his mask better with
								imperfection, it didn’t match hispersonality to do so.“No,” he said quietly.“I fought
								for your brother. I killed for him,” Samila said.“We all did an awful lot of that,”
								Gavin said.“I felt so betrayed by you, that you wouldn’t even acknowledge me afterwhat
								we’d had. I felt a glimmer of hope when you broke your betrothal withKarris. When I
								finally figured it all out, I still wasn’t sure of myself. Gavintold us things about
								you, about what you would do if you won. And youweren’t doing them. Was your brother a
								liar all along, or did you change?You were supposed to be a monster, Dazen.”“I am a
								monster.”“Glib, still. The snot-nosed younger brother with a quick tongue. I meanit.”
								She looked at him long and hard. Looked at the Freeing knife that hehadn’t drawn. “How
								well do you know yourself?”
							</p>

							<p>
								He thought about the years, the goals he’d achieved, and the ultimategoal it was
								serving. “The Philosopher said that a man alone is either a godor a monster,” Gavin
								said. “I’m no god.”
							</p>

							<p>
								She stared at him for one moment more, those intense blue eyesunreadable. She smiled.
								“Well then. Maybe the times call for a monster.”She knelt at his feet, and he blessed
								her.
							</p>

								Chapter 82
							</p>

							<p>
								Kip had always pictured a charge as being somehow glorious. Whateverhe’d pictured, it
								wasn’t this. He held his pants up with his wounded lefthand and the musket in his right.
								And the musket was heavy! His heart washeaving and everyone else was running faster than
								he was.
							</p>

							<p>
								He had little sense of what was happening anywhere else. A man whoroared that the
								soldiers could call him either god or Master Sergeant GalanDelelo ran at the front,
								urging his men on. The backs of the other soldiersfilled the rest of Kip’s vision, and
								the pain of running distracted him fromall else except for the intermittent whistling,
								which he couldn’t place at first—until he realized it was the sound of musket balls
								flying past, and then hecould hardly think of anything else.
							</p>

							<p>
								For a moment he saw the city walls as the men in front of himdisappeared in a ditch
								before scrambling up the other side. He remembereddismissing these walls not even a week
								ago. Now they looked prettyimpressive. The side of the wall was encrusted with slums
								like barnacles,and King Garadul’s men were already swarming there, trying to use the
								lowbuildings and rough shelters as a ladder. But even in the brief glimpse Kiphad, one
								of the slum buildings on which the men were climbing teeteredand then collapsed,
								crushing men and sending up a cloud of dust.
							</p>

							<p>
								Something wet and chunky splattered across Kip’s face as he ran. Heturned, vaguely saw a
								man dropping beside him—and then the groundsuddenly wasn’t where it was supposed to be.
							</p>

							<p>
								He went down hard in the dry irrigation ditch. He skidded on his face,flipped over,
								rolled, the wind knocked cleanly out of him. As he moaned,struggling to regain his
								breath, he realized he wasn’t alone. The irrigationditch was full of men cowering inside
								its marginal cover.
							</p>

							<p>
								Master Sergeant Galan Delelo appeared back on the lip of the ditch.“Get up, you pathetic
								rats! They’ve got an angle right into this ditch fromthe wall, you damn fools. Get up!
								If you’re anything less than dead, get upor I’ll shoot you myself!”
							</p>

							<p>
								For a second, no one moved.“You wouldn’t,” a man said.The master sergeant drew a pistol
								and shot him in the belly. “Who’snext?” he yelled. He pointed his other pistol at a man
								carrying a largerobin’s egg blue sack.“I’m a messenger!” the man screamed.“You’re a
								soldier now,” Master Sergeant Delelo shouted. He was eitherunaware or just didn’t care
								about the musket fire raining around him,sending up little puffs of earth. “Now, move!”
							</p>

							<p>
								The man dropped his messenger sack, grabbed Kip’s musket, and ranforward, along with
								everyone else.
							</p>

							<p>
								Lying on the ground, Kip was left with the other corpses. When he hadhis breath back, he
								touched the side of his face. Gore, gray-red chunks of…He didn’t want to think about it.
								What mattered was that he was free. Atleast until the next officer commandeered the
								cowards who filled up thisditch again.
							</p>

							<p>
								There wasn’t much time. If Kip thought too much or waited too long, hewouldn’t move, and
								he needed to move now. The master sergeant was right,this ditch wasn’t out of the line
								of fire. If Kip waited, he was going to getkilled.
							</p>

							<p>
								He wanted to see more of the battle, make a good plan. He didn’t knowwhat kind of a
								judge he would be of whatever he saw, and he didn’t evenknow which way to run.
							</p>

							<p>
								He grabbed the messenger’s sack and slung it over his shoulder. He sawthe wreck of a
								wagon farther back away from the wall.
							</p>

							<p>
								Did we run right past that? Kip hadn’t even noticed. Regardless, theoxen who’d been
								pulling the wagon were dead or mewling, screaming inpain, bloodied. Kip ran for it.
							</p>

							<p>
								He ducked into the shadow of the wagon and found two other menalready there. They looked
								at him with wide, fearful eyes. “Move!” heshouted.
							</p>

							<p>
								Kip climbed up on the wreck and looked out on the plain. At first all hesaw were the
								dead bodies. Several hundred perhaps. Mostly he couldn’t seeany blood, so it looked like
								people sprawled about sleeping. It wasn’t sogreat a toll, considering how big the army
								was, Kip thought, but seeing somany dead wasn’t really something he could merely think
								about. Thosepeople were dead. He could have been one of them. He could still be.
							</p>

							<p>
								He tore his eyes away, tried to look for something useful. In a few spotsat the wall,
								King Garadul’s men had actually reached the top of the wall.There was fighting in three
								or four places, defenders and attackers alikebeing thrown off, grappling, puffs of black
								smoke erupting everywherefrom musket and pistol fire.
							</p>

							<p>
								To Kip’s left, there was a slight hill, out of range of musket fire from thewall. There
								were several hundred horsemen and drafters around the hill. Infront of the hill,
								drafters were crafting a bridge over the irrigation ditch. Kipsaw then that the original
								bridge had been destroyed by the retreatingpeople of Garriston. It had slowed King
								Garadul’s advance, probably morebecause they’d stopped to talk about it than if they had
								simply charged thehorses through.
							</p>

							<p>
								At the top of the hill, Kip saw standard bearers and a figure who mighthave been King
								Garadul himself. He was shouting, making huge animatedmovements toward Lord Omnichrome,
								who was unmistakable because heliterally glowed in the early morning light.
							</p>

							<p>
								Kip didn’t realize he’d made a decision until he found himself running.
							</p>

							<p>
								He snatched a musket from the ground next to a woman curled in the fetalposition,
								moaning, and kept running. His vengeance was this close.
							</p>

							<p>
								As Kip approached the hill, movement began on the hill and rapidlyspread, horns sounding
								orders. It was a few seconds before Kip saw thehorses moving. King Garadul was advancing
								on the wall—personally, righttoward the Mother’s Gate. Was he trusting that his men
								would open the gateby the time he got there, or was he just an idiot?
							</p>

							<p>
								Kip was halfway up the hill when he saw a woman whose form seemedfamiliar. He stopped.
							</p>

							<p>
								Karris White Oak had flagged down one of the horsemen heading after
							</p>

							<p>
								King Garadul. The man slowed down for her, and she swung up into thesaddle behind him
								with surprising grace. The man turned in the saddle toask her a question, and then
								tumbled out. Kip saw the quick gleam of adagger, then it was sheathed, and Karris kicked
								the horse’s sides and wentspeeding after King Garadul. She was going by herself, and
								with her eyecaps still on. She wouldn’t be able to draft, but she was still going to try
								tokill him. Even if she were successful, it would be suicide.
							</p>

							<p>
								I swore to save her. And I swore to kill him.Kip was a terrible rider, but there was no
								way he could catch up withouta horse. Seeing horses tied up near the crown of the hill,
								he headed straightfor them.“… through the Lover’s Gate. You’ll have to swim. Join the
								refugees.
							</p>

							<p>
								He’ll—”
							</p>

							<p>
								Kip rounded a tent in time to see the young drafter Zymun swing up intoa saddle. He was
								taking orders from Lord Omnichrome himself. Kip’s heartleaped. They weren’t twenty paces
								away.“You need a horse?” someone said, right at Kip’s elbow.Kip almost jumped out of his
								skin. He blinked stupidly at the groom.“Rough work out there, huh?” the groom
								said.“Message!” Kip said, remembering he was carrying a messenger bag.“Message for the
								king! Yes, a horse! I need a horse.”“I figured,” the man said. He went off to find a
								beast large enough.Kip looked back toward Lord Omnichrome and Zymun. He missedwhatever
								else they said, but he saw Lord Omnichrome hand a box to themounted drafter.
							</p>

							<p>
								That box. Kip couldn’t believe it.That was his box. Right size. Right shape. That was
								his inheritance. Theonly thing his mother had ever given him. And Zymun had it.
							</p>

							<p>
								Zymun bowed to Lord Omnichrome. Kip sank back as the young drafterpulled his horse
								around and galloped away to the east. Lord Omnichromestrode back toward the crown of the
								hill. The groom brought Kip a horseand helped him mount and stash the musket in a sleeve
								beside the saddle.
							</p>

							<p>
								Kip looked, torn. Lord Omnichrome was disappearing up the hill,rejoining his entourage.
								He was the heart of this; Kip knew it. He shouldkill him. Orholam, his chance was
								passing through his fingertips. But to thesouth, Karris was charging to her death, and
								to the east, that snake Zymunwas stealing the only thing Kip had to remember his mother
								by. Kill LordOmnichrome and stop the war. Kill Zymun and take the knife. Or saveKarris
								and have a chance at King Garadul. Kip couldn’t get them all.
							</p>

							<p>
								Kip had made his oaths to the living and to the dead. He gritted histeeth, sure he was
								making the wrong decision—and making it anyway. It’sbetter that the innocent should live
								than that the guilty die. Gavin lovedKarris, and he deserved another chance at
								happiness. Kip rode after her.
							</p>

							<p>
								Chapter 83
							</p>

							<p>
								Karris had never fought in a full-scale battle before, but she had watchedseveral with
								Gavin’s general Running Wolf. In another age, he would havebeen revered as a great
								leader. Instead, he’d faced Corvan Danavis, andbeen thrice bested by smaller forces
								commanded by the mustachioedgenius. Regardless, he’d been a kindly older gentleman with
								a soft spot forKarris, and he would explain to her what he was seeing as the distant
								linesclashed. Of course, he was often too busy to tell her much, but at othertimes it
								seemed to help him to think out loud. So now as Karris gallopeddown the hill and headed
								toward the fray, she was able to piece togethermore than she would have otherwise.
							</p>

							<p>
								The buildings propped against both sides of the wall—the feature thatwould eventually
								doom it, Karris was sure—were actually helping in theshort term. They were like a talus
								slope, wide enough that it encumberedanyone bringing forward siege ladders, and too
								unpredictable to charge menstraight up at any one place. Eventually, King Garadul’s men
								would figureout which places were stable and how much weight they could support,
								butuntil then the collapsing buildings killed and slowed the men attacking thewall.
							</p>

							<p>
								As Karris rode in, drafters appeared at the top of the wall en masse forthe first time.
								The wall wasn’t high, but it was wide enough for thedefenders to move along the top at
								great speed, and they’d seen KingGaradul’s cavalry coming here.
							</p>

							<p>
								Reds and sub-reds worked in teams from the top of the walls, oneflinging sticky pyre
								jelly down onto the attackers, and the other setting italight. King Garadul had a line
								of his own drafters up front, blues andgreens attempting to divert the pyre jelly in
								midair and throw it back at thewall. Reds threw their own luxin up at the defenders on
								the wall, thoughGaradul’s teams weren’t as good at getting it alight every time. On
								bothsides, musketeers did their best to pick off drafters.
							</p>

							<p>
								The defenders were getting the best of it, but there were simply so manyattackers,
								Karris didn’t see how they could possibly hold out for long. Andwhy had King Garadul
								brought his cavalry here now? Directly against thewall, their maneuverability was
								negated and they made easy targets for theblue drafters at the top of the wall, who
								would pop up from behind thecrenellations, fire off a few daggers of blue, and then duck
								back down.
							</p>

							<p>
								All Karris had to do was muscle her way through the crowd—not hardwhen you were
								mounted—steal a musket, stay alive long enough to getclose to King Garadul, and blow his
								head off. In the heat and fury and bloodand confusion and cacophony of battle, it was
								quite possible no one wouldeven realize the killing shot had come from behind him.
							</p>

							<p>
								Karris heard a yell behind her, somehow different from the rest of thescreams. She
								turned her head, still leaning low over her galloping horse. Adozen Mirrormen, coming
								after her on their gigantic chargers. Her heartconvulsed.
							</p>

							<p>
								So the subtle approach isn’t going to work.She picked at the eye caps again. The skin at
								the corner of her eye wastearing, but she wasn’t any closer to pulling the damned things
								off. If shecould draft, she would have a chance. She pushed down the sudden flood ofred
								fury with effort.
							</p>

							<p>
								Eighty paces out, she saw a line of musketeers reloading. She scannedthe crowd for
								anyone bearing a flintlock—a matchlock wouldn’t work forthis. Then, slowing her horse to
								get the timing right, she swept in just as oneof the officers finished reloading and
								hefted the musket up to his shoulder.She snatched it right out of his hands.
							</p>

							<p>
								Commander Ironfist had often chided her for her trick riding, forpracticing things they
								both knew had no use beyond impressing theBlackguard’s new recruits. A vision of the big
								man’s head shaking inamused surrender went through her head as she jammed the musket
								into thesaddle sleeve. She was wearing this damn dress that left her half naked andhalf
								totally restricted. She wasn’t really going to—Karris kicked her feetfree of the
								stirrups, turned her wrist behind her back to get a firm grip onthe cantle, tucked the
								reins between horse and pommel, and dismounted asthe horse continued at a canter. She
								hit the ground and instantly leapt,twisting, feeling the sleeves of her dress rip. She’d
								always practiced thiswith a better cantle, but she’d also practiced on taller horses,
								and she almostflung herself over the side of the saddle on her way back up. It took a
								half amoment, but she settled into the saddle, backward. She drew the musket,leveled it,
								trying to absorb as much of shock of the horse’s cantering in herknees as she could,
								trying to time how long it would take between triggerpull and musket fire. She aimed at
								the lead Mirrorman forty paces behindher and pulled the trigger.
							</p>

							<p>
								She’d aimed perfectly, timed everything right, but the musket didn’t fire.
							</p>

							<p>
								She cocked the flintlock again, checked the mechanism. No flint. It hadfallen out,
								probably during her impressive trick riding. Bollocks!
							</p>

							<p>
								Karris threw the musket away, reversed her hands, turned her head overher shoulder to
								make sure she’d be leaping off flat ground, and dismounted.The reverse dismount and
								remount was actually much harder than theoriginal trick, but she did it perfectly, both
								feet hitting the ground, pushingoff in tandem just as the pull of the horse’s forward
								motion catapulted herinto the air. Except as she was pulled up and forward, half of her
								horse’shead was torn off by a musket ball and its body dove for the earth. If she’dstill
								been holding the reins, she’d have been flung to earth too. Instead, shebecame a human
								cannonball. The force of her jump and the horse’s suddendive had her twisting like a
								cat. She was flying, upside down and backward.
							</p>

							<p>
								Time only for one thought: Roll when you hit.But when she hit, there was no time for
								anything at all. Whatever it was,there were multiple levels, and it was mercifully
								soft—which didn’t stop itfrom whipping her head and limbs in different directions. When
								she finallyhit ground, she couldn’t move for a few long seconds.
							</p>

							<p>
								Someone was cursing. She saw feet. She was lying on top of a man, andhe was struggling
								to get out from under her. She must have crashed into thebacks of half a dozen
								soldiers—and taken them all out with her. One manhad his leg twisted at a nasty angle.
								Another turned to look at her, his nosefountaining blood, cursing.
							</p>

							<p>
								A huge explosion took away whatever he was saying. Perhaps sixtypaces away. Everything
								seemed to freeze for a moment on the battlefield,then things began moving too fast to
								take them all in at once.
							</p>

							<p>
								Karris jumped to her feet—and almost collapsed. She was solightheaded that it took all
								of her concentration not to fall. She checkedherself quickly. There were stinging
								abrasions on her arms and legs, dressin pathetic shape, but no serious wounds. She
								touched her eyes. The eyecaps were unbroken, of course. And smudged with blood so they
								wereharder to see through. Just perfect.
							</p>

							<p>
								Now that she was in the midst of the battle, the world narrowed. Therewere images like
								little paintings, but no whole. Karris saw a drafter up onthe Mother’s Gate—Izem Blue?
								What was he doing here? He stood, skinfully blue, both arms extended, shooting blue
								daggers in rapid succession—an absolutely stunning display to work so fast, keeping his
								will focused,shooting from both hands. He was like a dozen musketeers—three
								dozen,despite the hazy quality of the morning’s misty sunlight. Everywhere heturned, men
								went down. He turned toward the Mirrormen, and Karris sawthose blue blades shearing off
								in every direction from the mirror armor,chewing through everyone around the Mirrormen,
								but sometimes catching achink or hitting the mirror armor flat enough that a knife
								punched through.
							</p>

							<p>
								A body stood in front of Karris, headless, its neck spraying blood intime with the last
								beats of its heart.
							</p>

							<p>
								The sound of muskets firing and the roar of blood in her ears meldedtogether, a pulse,
								life and death twined together.
							</p>

							<p>
								The Mirrormen surged toward a hole in the wall, perhaps seven pacesacross. So that was
								where the explosion had been.
							</p>

							<p>
								A red drafter—one of King Garadul’s Free—had gone mad. He wascackling, throwing pyre
								jelly on everyone around him. The men splatteredwith the stuff were shouting in fear.
								Someone was begging him to stop.
							</p>

							<p>
								A man was falling off the shattered edge of the wall, slipping,screaming.
							</p>

							<p>
								Off to one side atop the wall, the sun gleamed off a man’s copper hair.
							</p>

							<p>
								Karris’s eyes locked on him. Gavin! He leaned close to another man, issuedan order.
								Corvan Danavis. So the man really was a general. And he washere? Gavin clapped the man
								on the shoulder, and they parted.
							</p>

							<p>
								Karris turned, remembering the pursuing Mirrormen, perhaps too late.The leader was
								twenty paces back, horse surging through the lines,shouting at men to move aside, sword
								drawn. He was alone, his men cut offbehind him by a sudden sideways surge in the line,
								but he was too close.Karris was unarmed and still wobbly on her feet.
							</p>

							<p>
								Ten paces away, her pursuer seemed to jump in his saddle. Karris couldsee the whole
								front of his body, so he hadn’t been shot from the wall, butnonetheless, he tumbled out
								of his saddle.
							</p>

							<p>
								Someone had killed the man from behind. What the hell? Karris lookedbehind the man.
							</p>

							<p>
								Kip.Kip? The young man was riding at a full gallop behind the Mirrormen,following the
								path they’d pushed open through the ranks of soldiers. But hedidn’t have a musket.
							</p>

							<p>
								Instead, he was carrying a big green ball, larger than his own head. Hisskin was green,
								and he had a wild look in his eyes—and he looked like hewas going to tumble out of the
								saddle at any moment.
							</p>

							<p>
								Not seeming to care that he was guiding his horse directly into otherhorses, Kip drew
								the green globe backward like he was throwing a ball—classic tyro misperception, they
								always thought that because a ball hadmass, you had to muscle it. Kip’s arm came
								forward, and then with anaudible pop he shot the green globe out at the Mirrormen.
							</p>

							<p>
								It caught one in the side of his mirrored helmet. The mirror armorsheared luxin easily,
								but it still had to deal with the momentum of what washitting it. A breastplate might
								withstand a bullet, but the man inside wasstill going to have some broken ribs. Here,
								the man’s head snapped to theside, blasting him out of the saddle, and the green globe
								ricocheted off,hitting another Mirrorman’s shoulder and not quite dismounting him,
								thencaromed into a third Mirrorman’s horse, catching the animal on the side ofits head
								and knocking it off its feet.
							</p>

							<p>
								The force of the shot blew Kip out of his own saddle, almost halting allof his forward
								motion. His horse shied, trying not to collide with the othersat the last second, but
								they had been startled by riders falling and a giantgreen ball flying past their heads,
								and one dodged directly into its new path.Animal collided with animal at great speed,
								crunching a Mirrorman’s legthat was trapped between them.
							</p>

							<p>
								Both horses went down, but Karris was more concerned about Kip. Shelost sight of him
								when he fell. Soldiers were still a river, pressing past theMirrormen, not knowing or
								caring much what this fight was about. Theyjust wanted to get out of the shadow of these
								deadly walls and into the city.
							</p>

							<p>
								Karris snatched a sword off the ground and ducked through the crowd.
							</p>

							<p>
								Three riders had wheeled around and were pushing toward a spot fartherback. She couldn’t
								get there in time.
							</p>

							<p>
								One was drawing his musket from the saddle sheath to kill her when hishead exploded in a
								burst of yellow light and pink mist. Karris was sure thistime the shot hadn’t come from
								the wall. It had to have come from theopposite direction—from the hill? And what the
								hell could have done that?An explosive musket ball?
							</p>

							<p>
								She was still too far away. She saw two Mirrormen pulling muskets out,aiming down.
							</p>

							<p>
								Twin green spears—pillars, almost, they were so thick—erupted fromthe ground where the
								riders were pointing and impaled them. The first onewas hit square in the chest. Green
								light fractured out in a spray as themirrored breastplate held for a moment, and then
								burst—and still the greenspear shot up, lifting the Mirrorman up into the air. The other
								man was nomore lucky. That spear hit the top of his breastplate, again shearing
								someluxin away into a flash of green light. Then the spear rode up, catching himunder
								the chin and going into his head, ripping his helmet off his ruinedhead like a child
								popping the head off a dandelion.
							</p>

							<p>
								Each was lifted several paces into the air before the green luxin spearscracked and
								dropped them to the ground and dissolved to nothing.
							</p>

							<p>
								Kip jumped to his feet, looking a lot less dead than he deserved.Karris arrived a moment
								later. He gave her a curious look, and she said,“Kip, it’s me. Do you recognize me? It’s
								Karris.” Despite that astoundingdisplay of power, Kip was a new drafter, and the mental
								and emotionaleffects of the colors were always greatest when you first started.
								Thewildness of green could make a drafter dangerous.
							</p>

							<p>
								He lifted a hand quickly and she flinched. “Kip, it’s me, Karris,” shesaid, all too
								aware that there was still a battle going on, though the amountof musket fire from the
								top of the wall had dwindled to almost nothing.“Hold still,” he said, staring intently
								at her face. He brought up a singlefinger and moved it as if to poke her in the eye. She
								could feel the heatradiating from it. What? Kip was a sub-red, too?
							</p>

							<p>
								There was a hiss as he touched the eye cap, and he must have hit thefuse point because
								the eye cap dissolved. Then he did the other.
							</p>

							<p>
								And like that, Karris could draft again.Oh, hell yes.“What do you say?” Kip asked.What
								was he talking about? “Thank you?” Karris asked.“I say we go kill us a king,” Kip said,
								grinning recklessly. When theywere in the grip of their color, greens didn’t tend to be
								real big on commonsense.
							</p>

							<p>
								Karris looked and saw that Rask Garadul was just getting to the gapthey’d blown in the
								wall. Half of his men were already through. It was theperfect time to attack—well, other
								than the fact that Karris and Kip were onthe side of the wall with King Garadul’s entire
								army.
							</p>

							<p>
								Drafting some red off the pools of gore around them, Karris felt thecomforting wash of
								red rage. She felt strong. “Let’s go kill us a king,” shesaid.
							</p>

							<p>
								Chapter 84
							</p>

							<p>
								I’m not important enough for this, Liv thought as Lord Omnichrome cameback to the top of
								the hill where she was tied up. From her vantage point,she could see a familiar form
								taking a big red stallion from a groom, thenmounting. Kip. If he turned around, he
								couldn’t help but see her.
							</p>

							<p>
								For a moment, Liv wasn’t sure if she wanted him to see her or not. Shehad no doubt what
								he would do if he did. He’d come charging up the hill,and to hell with the odds. That
								was Kip. That was who he was and who healways had been. Not always smart, but always
								ferociously loyal.
							</p>

							<p>
								She ducked her head. There was only death here for Kip. And sureenough, he turned for
								one second as he sat unsteadily atop the big horse.Then he kicked his heels in and
								almost tumbled out of the saddle as theanimal surged forward.
							</p>

							<p>
								Liv almost grinned at the sight, but the looming figure of Lord
							</p>

							<p>
								Omnichrome wiped away any thought of amusement. As he came close, sherealized he wasn’t
								as big as he seemed from a distance. His white robes andthe white cape hanging off great
								blue horns rising from his shoulders madehim seem bigger than a mortal man, but he
								wasn’t even as tall as GavinGuile. But he glowed. It was like yellow luxin filled his
								veins instead ofblood. His hair had been sculpted into a spiky crown with yellow luxin,
								soit dazzled, as if he’d been crowned by the sun itself, and his eyes beneathwere a
								constant riot of colors. And he was staring at her.
							</p>

							<p>
								I’m not important enough for this, she thought again. Her cheek wasthrobbing, still
								dribbling blood. The powder wagon’s explosion hadknocked her unconscious, and shrapnel
								had cut her in a dozen places. Shedidn’t know how they’d found her among all the bodies.
								She didn’t knowwhy they would want her.“How did you come to be here, Aliviana
								Danavis?”“I walked, mostly,” she said. Danavis, so that was it. They knew herfather was
								commanding the enemy army. And she’d stupidly deliveredherself into their hands. Well
								done, Liv.
							</p>

							<p>
								Lord Omnichrome’s retainers surrounded them: broken-haloed draftersof every type,
								soldiers, messengers, and a few high-ranking officers fromKing Garadul’s camp who looked
								decidedly uneasy around all the drafters,much less Lord Omnichrome. Lord Omnichrome
								picked up a strangemusket as long as he was tall. He lifted it, fitted its leg into a
								slot on thebarrel, propped it up in front of himself, and aimed down the hill toward
								thefighting.“Dead center on that green door,” he said.“Third house from the left?” a
								spotter asked.Liv didn’t know much about muskets, but she knew you couldn’t make ashot
								that accurate at three hundred paces. Not that you’d want someoneshooting in your
								direction, but past one hundred paces aiming was more ageneral hope. Nonetheless, Lord
								Omnichrome took a deep breath, sighteddown the barrel through the mists, fired.
							</p>

							<p>
								The musket roared.“Three hands high, one hand left,” the spotter said.Lord Omnichrome
								handed the musket to an attendant, who beganreloading it. He turned to Liv. “I want you
								to join me, Liv. I saw you, lastnight, listening. You understood. I could tell you did.”
							</p>

								Orholam, she thought he’d looked at her, but then she’d dismissed it asher imagination.
								There had been thousands listening last night. And howdid he recognize her?“You love
								your father, don’t you, Liv?”“More than anything,” she said. How did he know her name,
								much lessher nickname?“And how old is he?”“Maybe forty?” she said.“Old, then. For a
								drafter. If he weren’t a drafter, he could live anotherforty years. But as a drafter
								loyal to the Chromeria, he’s an old dog already,isn’t he? Most men don’t make it to
								forty. Your father must be verydisciplined, very strong.”“Stronger than you know,” Liv
								said. She felt a surge of emotion. Whowas this bastard, talking about her father? She
								wouldn’t let anyone speakbadly of him. He was a great man. Even if he had made mistakes.
							</p>

							<p>
								The attendant handed the long musket back to Lord Omnichrome. Heraised it, stabilized
								its significant weight on its leg, and said, “Blue drafter,just right of the gatehouse.”
							</p>

							<p>
								Liv watched, horrified, as Lord Omnichrome waited. The blue drafterwas ducked behind a
								crenellation, popping up to throw death down on themen below and ducking down again. He
								popped up, Lord Omnichromesaid, “Heart.” The musket roared.
							</p>

							<p>
								A burst of light and blood and the drafter disappeared from view.“Shoulder, your left,”
								the attendant said. “One hand left and threethumbs high.”
							</p>

							<p>
								Lord Omnichrome handed the musket back to the man with a politethank-you. “When the time
								comes, will you tell them?” he asked Liv.“Tell them? Tell them about my father?” Liv
								hesitated. “I’ll do what Ineed to do.”“What you need to do. Interesting how they make it
								that, isn’t it? Whatif you couldn’t make it back to the Chromeria in time? Would you
								kill yourfather yourself, with your own hand? What if he asked you to stop? What ifhe
								begged you?”“My father isn’t such a coward.”“You’re dodging the question.” Lord
								Omnichrome’s eyes were swirlingorange. Liv had never liked oranges much. Always unnerved
								her. When shedidn’t speak for a long moment, he said, “I understand perfectly. When
								Istarted my own Chromeria, I followed them blindly at first, too. Despitewhat I am. One
								of my students broke the halo and I murdered her with myown hands. She wasn’t the first
								to die for the drafters’ ignorance nor thelast, but she was the beginning of the end.
								When I killed her, I knew what Idid was wrong. I couldn’t shake it.”“Drafters go mad.
								Like you. They turn on their friends. They kill thosethey love.”“Oh, absolutely.
								Sometimes. Some people can’t handle power. Somemen seem decent until you give them a
								slave, and soon they’re a tyrant,beating and raping the slave in their charge. Power is
								a test, Liv. All poweris a test. We don’t call it breaking the halo. We call it breaking
								the egg. Younever know what kind of bird is going to be hatched. And some are
								borndeformed and must be put down. That is tragedy, but not murder. Do youthink your
								father could handle a little extra power? The great CorvanDanavis? An immensely talented
								drafter who’s nevertheless had thediscipline to make it to forty?”“It’s not that
								simple,” Liv said.“What if it is? What if the Chromeria has perpetuated this
								monstrositybecause this is how they keep themselves in power? By scaring thesatrapies,
								saying that only they can train the drafters born among them—fora price, always for a
								price—and only they can restrain the drafters who gomad, which is all of them. By doing
								that, they make themselves foreveruseful, forever powerful, and by divvying out drafters
								to the satrapies, theymake themselves the center of everything. Tell me, Liv, when you
								judge theChromeria by its fruit, do you find it a place of love and peace and light—as
								one might expect from Orholam’s holy city?”“No,” Liv admitted. She didn’t even know why
								she was defending it,except out of stubbornness. The Chromeria was everything she hated,
								and itdefiled all it touched. Including her. She owed debts there, and she couldn’tlie
								to herself so much that she would believe her flight to Tyrea and tofollow Kip wasn’t
								partly a flight from her debt to Aglaia Crassos andRuthgar.“The truth is, Liv, you know
								I’m right. You’re just afraid to admityou’ve been on the wrong side. I understand. We
								all do. There are goodmen and women who fight against us, good people! But they’re
								deluded,deceived. It hurts to leave a lie, but it hurts more to live one. Look at
								whatI’m doing. I’m freeing a city that’s ours, by rights. Garriston has beenpassed
								around like a whore to be abused by every nation in turn. It’s notright. It has to end,
								and since no one else will end it, we will. Does not thisland deserve freedom? Should
								these people pay because two brothers—neither of whom was born here or cared a whit for
								this land—fought here?For how long should they pay?”“They shouldn’t,” Liv said.“Because
								it isn’t just.”He took the long musket from the attendant again. “Red drafter, top ofthe
								gatehouse. Head.”
							</p>

							<p>
								Liv watched. The battle in front of the Mother’s Gate was hard to seeclearly through all
								the smoke and flashes of magic. But she saw KingGaradul’s cavalry reaching the gate,
								loading their muskets and firing at themen at the top of the wall, but seeming to wait
								for something, frustrated ithadn’t happened yet. Lord Omnichrome’s musket roared, and an
								instantlater there was a small bright flash at the top of the gate tower. Liv was
								gladshe hadn’t seen all of it.“Dead center, Lord Omnichrome,” the attendant announced.
								“Excellentshot!”“Begone! Leave us.” The top of the hill cleared quickly of everyonesave
								the musket attendant, whom Lord Omnichrome gestured to stay. LordOmnichrome turned
								toward Liv. He wasn’t smiling. “I don’t like killingdrafters. I hate it,” he said. “What
								I do here is what must be done. I wantyou to join me, Aliviana.”“Why? Why me? I’m barely
								a bichrome, not that powerful, noinfluence.”
							</p>

							<p>
								He snorted. “Are you ready for the answer to that question? You want tobe an adult,
								Aliviana? You want hard truths? Because that’s the only kindI’ve known for the past
								sixteen years.”“I’m ready,” she said.“I want you because you’re a drafter and every
								drafter is precious to me.
							</p>

							<p>
								And because you’re Tyrean, and this country will take a lot of reassuringafter we win,
								and I’m not Tyrean. And because you’re Corvan Danavis’sdaughter.”“I knew it!” she
								spat.“Listen, you half-wit! Listen or you’re unworthy of the role I have foryou anyway.”
							</p>

							<p>
								That shut her up.“As Corvan’s daughter, I have some hope that you’re half as
								intelligentas he is. If so, you’ll be a formidable ally. I need bright leaders. But I
								won’tlie to you. I hope that your coming to our side might free your father fromthe
								Chromeria’s grip. I suspect that he only serves the Prism because theyheld you hostage.
								If that’s true, Corvan might come over to us, and having ageneral of his standing on our
								side might prevent any further war from evenbeing necessary. That’s how much fear your
								father inspires. Men won’teven take the field against him. During the Prisms’ War, his
								enemies woulduse spyglasses to see which general was directing a battle. If it was
								yourfather, they would retreat and fight another day. That’s how good yourfather is, and
								I’d be a fool to ignore him when he might fight for me. If youthink that’s me
								manipulating you, you’re right. I’ll use you. You’reimportant. The Chromeria will use
								you too. Already has. Grow up andrealize it. I’ll be honest about it, that’s all. And my
								honesty gives you achoice. That’s better than they’ll give you.” His eyes were threaded
								with redand orange, like flames.
							</p>

							<p>
								He was right. It was true. And if that was true, what if all of it was true?“King
								Garadul slaughtered my whole town.”“Yes. He even took some of my drafters and made them
								help him.”Liv had expected him to deny it, excuse it.“And yet you’d have me serve
								him?”Lord Omnichrome lowered his voice. “Kings don’t live forever.
							</p>

							<p>
								Especially reckless ones.”
							</p>

							<p>
								A huge explosion rocked the wall to the left of the gatehouse. It waspowerful enough
								that it threw many of the combatants off their feet, andmore than a few people off the
								wall itself, but as the smoke graduallycleared, to Liv it seemed that the charge must
								have been planted on theother side of the wall—the damage that she could see there was
								much moreextensive, rows of houses simply obliterated. A cheer went up among thecavalry,
								though, as the clearing smoke showed a gap blasted in the wallitself.“You see, the
								people of Garriston are working with us. They want to befree.”
							</p>

							<p>
								But Liv barely heard him. She’d just seen something through the mistson the battlefield
								that took her breath away. Kip. And not just Kip. Kip andKarris both were riding into
								the fray. For a moment, Liv didn’t understand.Kip and Karris had switched sides? They
								were fighting to free Garriston?Then her eyes followed the path they were taking. The
								path led straight toKing Garadul.
							</p>

							<p>
								King Garadul, who Kip hated for wiping out their town and killing hismother.
							</p>

							<p>
								And they were being pursued by half a dozen mounted Mirrormen.“How much am I worth to
								you?” Liv said.“I’ve already told you.”“Then I’m yours, on one condition.”The red
								swirled out of his eyes, replaced by orange and blue.“Save my friends. Him, and her. The
								ones those Mirrormen are after.”
							</p>

							<p>
								She pointed.
							</p>

							<p>
								Lord Omnichrome beckoned his attendant sharply, and the man camerunning with his long
								musket. “You wish me to kill several allies in order togain one,” Lord Omnichrome said.
								“You barter lives like—”“Like an adult,” Liv said sharply.“And a formidable one indeed.
								But I’m not in the business of buyingloyalty. I’ll do my best to save your friends. As a
								gift, regardless of whatyou decide.” He sighted down his musket and fired. A Mirrorman
								ridingtoward Karris died in a flash of light and blood. Lord Omnichrome handedthe musket
								off to be reloaded.“So take that out of your calculations, Liv, but tell me now, whom
								willyou serve? Me, or the Chromeria?”
							</p>

							<p>
								Fealty to One. And to one only.There was no good choice. There were no good guys. Trying
								to do theright thing had led Liv to spying on her greatest benefactor. The
								Chromeriacorrupted even people’s love for each other. Everyone she knew said
								LordOmnichrome was a monster, but everyone she knew had been corrupted bythe Chromeria.
								So maybe Lord Omnichrome wasn’t perfect. Neither wasGavin. The only people innocent here
								were the people of Tyrea. Theydeserved to be free. If Liv had to fight, she wasn’t going
								to fight for theiroppressors. Fealty to One? A Danavis had to choose whom she
								wouldserve? So be it.
							</p>

							<p>
								Taking a deep breath, Liv gave a full Tyrean formal curtsey. “Lord
							</p>

							<p>
								Omnichrome,” she said, her voice even, her eyes meeting his. “I’m yours.How may I
								serve?”
							</p>

							<p>
								Chapter 85“Traitors!” Kip heard a woman say. His head snapped toward Karris. Shespat on
								the dead Mirrormen. Imperious, masterful.
							</p>

							<p>
								What is she doing?Karris grabbed a musket and powder horn and began reloading it, as
								ifshe were a simple soldier. When Kip saw the looks on the faces of thesoldiers near
								them, he finally understood. They’d just seen her and Kipfight Mirrormen, but none of
								the surrounding men knew who was fightingon which side or if they should interfere. It
								looked like these soldiers hadlost all of their officers—not surprising, since the
								defenders on the wallwould try to kill officers first. That was probably the only reason
								Kip andKarris were still alive.“Well, drafter?” she said, finishing her reloading. She
								was as fast at thatas she was at everything. Her skin was the color of blood. Her eyes
								were nolonger capped with the violet eye caps that kept her from drafting. Wait, hadhe
								done that? He was feeling shaky, drained. Her bluff had worked, though.The soldiers were
								turning back to the fighting, determined not to get in theway of this virago.
							</p>

							<p>
								She was talking to him.That’s right, genius, seeing how you’re the one who just drafted
								twohuge spikes and impaled a couple of Mirrormen.
							</p>

							<p>
								Which made Kip look toward the men he’d killed. Mistake. One had afrothy gore-hole in
								his chest the size of Kip’s fist. The other’s head was tornin pieces, chunks of white
								bone mixed amid red in a picture that refused tocoalesce into a face.“Kip, ordinarily
								this is a bad idea when you’re as new as you are, but Iwant you to draft more green. I
								need you with me,” Karris hissed.
							</p>

							<p>
								He was staring at the smear of head on the ground. The soldiers pushingtoward the gate
								were trampling right over the pieces of brain and bone,giving more room to the two
								drafters than they did to the men Kip hadkilled.“Kip!” She slapped him, hard. “Cry
								later. Be a man now.” The reddiamonds in her emerald eyes blazed. She cursed, cast about
								for a moment,looking for something, then a few threads of green wove their way from
								hereyes to her fingertips through the ocean of red that colored her pale skin,and she
								drafted something small in her hands.
							</p>

							<p>
								Spectacles. Spectacles entirely of green luxin. She put them on his face,adjusted them,
								did something to seal them, and then stepped away. “Nowdraft!” she ordered.
							</p>

							<p>
								Kip was a sponge. It was like going outside on a hot day, closing hiseyes, and basking
								in the heat. Everywhere he looked there were light-colored surfaces, homes and shops
								whitewashed against the sun, and everyone of them gave him magic. He soaked it in,
								feeling potent. Free. Thethrobbing in his burned hand faded to nothing.
							</p>

							<p>
								He joined the stream of soldiers heading toward the gap in the wall. Themusket fire from
								atop the wall had all but ceased. It was turning into aglorious morning, bright, crisp,
								slowly burning off the mist. It would be hotsoon.
							</p>

							<p>
								Where before, when he was unmoving, the stream of men had partedaround him like a
								boulder as they saw that he was a drafter, as soon as hejoined the stream he was jostled
								about just like everyone else. The linescompressed the closer they got to the wall, and
								men trying to stay with theirunits pushed hard. As it got tighter and tighter, more and
								more constrained,Kip started to rebel against it. He wasn’t sure how much of the
								agitationwas his, and how much was the green luxin’s influence on him, but hecould tell
								that there was more to his reaction than his own psyche.
							</p>

							<p>
								With the confluence of horses and men in armor—though only a smallfraction of King
								Garadul’s army was armored or uniformed, those soldierswere intent on going in first—Kip
								lost sight of King Garadul himself.Karris had slipped into the line in front of him, and
								she was using herslender form and muscles to slip in between rows and push forward.
								Kipsoon lost sight of her too. It was all he could do to keep on his feet as thecrowd
								packed tight together right at the wall.“You!” someone shouted.Kip looked. A horseman,
								ten paces away, was staring at him. Kip had noidea who the man was.“You!” the officer
								repeated. “You’re not one of us!”At first, Kip had no idea who the man was. He thought
								maybe it was oneof the soldiers who’d escorted him with Zymun after Kip had blown up
								thefire. But even that was only a guess. Unfortunately, it didn’t matter. Theman
								recognized him.
							</p>

							<p>
								The officer tugged at his musket, trying to pull it from the saddle sleeve,but there
								were other horses pressing in on either side of him, and it wasstuck.“Spy! Traitor!” the
								officer shouted, pointing at Kip. “He doesn’t havethe sleeves! He’s not one of us!
								Murderer! Spy! That green drafter is aspy!”
							</p>

							<p>
								Kip had been pushed up the rubble pile to the gap in the wall itself. Itput him at a
								high point. Everyone was able to see him.
							</p>

							<p>
								The officer finally pulled his musket free and kicked his horse savagelyto come after
								Kip. Turned backward looking at the man, not really believinghe would fire into a crowd
								of his compatriots, Kip lifted his hands to draftsomething, anything. His foot slid on
								the rubble, and the surging crowd,some pulling away, some reaching toward him, threw him
								off balance. Hewent down in stages. The people were packed so tight that he didn’t fall
								allat once, but neither could he stop himself once he started.
							</p>

							<p>
								The gap in the wall vomited them into Garriston. Kip fell and rolled.Someone stepped on
								his burned left hand. He screamed. Feet werehitting his sides, someone tripped over him,
								someone stepped on his belly,someone kicked the side of his head. He tumbled, rolling
								down the slighthill of rubble, tried to gain his feet, and got smacked with the stock of
								amusket. He ended up on his back, head ringing, left hand on fire with pain,eyes having
								trouble focusing. Without meaning to, he’d gone turtle again,as he had when Mistress
								Helel had tried to kill him—and again, he wasabout as effective as a turtle on its back.
							</p>

							<p>
								It was like the world knew Kip needed to take the coward’s way, and itconspired together
								to land him here.
							</p>

							<p>
								The next thing he knew, there were people on every side of him,kicking, kicking. Some
								were trying to slam musket butts down on him, butthere were so many people packed in so
								tightly around him that he only felta few glancing blows on his legs. Back in the old
								days, he would haverolled over on his stomach and buried his head in his hands, rolled
								into aball and waited until Ram had asserted his superiority again and tired of thegame
								and left him. Doing that here would be death.
							</p>

							<p>
								Do you expect me to take a whipping lying down?Yes, Kip. It’s your way.You expect me to
								die lying down?Face it, Kip, you’re not much of a fighter, not when it matters. Whydon’t
								you curl up in a ball and quit?
							</p>

							<p>
								Part of him expected Karris to save him. She was a fighter. A warrior. Adrafter. She was
								quick and decisive, nimble and deadly with magic or blade.
							</p>

							<p>
								The crowd was like a beast, a seething, teeming, roaring mass that hadlost all
								individuality. And Kip hated it. He ducked his head as someone triedto stomp on him. He
								saw leering faces. Brief images of snarling mouths.Visages twisted with hatred.
							</p>

							<p>
								Part of him expected Ironfist to save him. The man had swept in out ofnowhere twice
								before and done that. Ironfist was huge, strong, intimidating.He was as quiet and as
								unmoving as steel. A guardian.
							</p>

							<p>
								Part of him expected Liv to save him. Why not? She’d come in at thelast minute to save
								him from the assassin Mistress Helel.
							</p>

							<p>
								Part of him expected Gavin to save him. What good was a Prism if hecouldn’t save his own
								bastard? Gavin was here. Somewhere. He had to beclose. He had to know the wall had been
								breached. He had to be hurryinghere even now.
							</p>

							<p>
								A kick caught Kip in the kidney, sending lances of pain through hiswhole body. As he
								lurched, a fist caught him in the face. His head bouncedoff the stones. Blood shot out
								of his nose, drenching his mouth and chin.
							</p>

							<p>
								No one was coming. Like when his mother had locked him in acupboard when he was eight
								years old because he’d complained or talkedtoo much or—he didn’t even remember what he’d
								done wrong. He justremembered the look of disgust on her face. She despised him. She
								threwhis soup at him and locked the door and went out to get high. And forgotabout him.
								Because he was worthless.
							</p>

							<p>
								After a day, the rats had come. He woke to one licking the dried soup offhis neck. Its
								little claws dug into his chest, its weight terrifyingly heavy.He’d screamed, jumped to
								his feet, thrashed. Screamed and screamed, andno one heard. That rat ran away, but soon,
								in the darkness, more had come.They dropped into his hair, bit his bare toes, scrambled
								up his pant legs.They were everywhere. Dozens of them. Hundreds, for all he knew.
								He’dscreamed until his throat was raw, thrashed and hit at them until his handswere
								bleeding, twisted his ankle on some old boxes crammed into thecupboard. And no one had
								come.
							</p>

							<p>
								His mother had found him on the morning of the third day, curled in aball, head tucked
								in his arms, whimpering, dehydrated, long bloody woundsall over his head, shoulders,
								back, and legs, not even trying to dislodge therats covering him like a cloak. There
								were a dozen dead rats with him andmore live ones. She’d given him water, eyes
								haze-glazed, begrudginglycleaned his wounds with the last of her harsh lemon liquor, and
								thenwandered out to find more haze. All without a word. She seemed to haveforgotten it
								all when he next saw her. He still had scars on his shoulders,back, and butt where the
								rats had bit him.
							</p>

							<p>
								No one’s coming, Kip. Another kick. You always were adisappointment. Another kick. A
								failure. Kick. You’re not good at anything.Kick.“Enough! Enough!” someone shouted. The
								officer finally pushedthrough the crowd, carrying his musket. “Move back!” he shouted.
							</p>

							<p>
								He hefted the musket, pointing it at Kip’s head.What can I do? Draft little green balls?
								Fine.Kip drafted a green ball and threw it up into the yawning barrel, willed itto stay.
							</p>

							<p>
								The officer pulled the trigger. A moment, then the musket exploded inhis hands. The
								breach of the musket blew out, throwing flaming blackpowder into the man’s face, setting
								his beard alight. He screamed, fell back.“Kill him!” someone shouted.Kip saw steel being
								drawn on all sides, flashes of the sun on blades. Andhe started laughing. Because he was
								good at something.
							</p>

							<p>
								He was good at taking punishment. He was a turtle. Or maybe a bear. Aturtle-bear.
								Orholam, he was an idiot. He laughed again, slapping his handsto his shoulders as he lay
								on the ground. Green luxin jetted out, coveringhim like he’d seen it cover the green
								wight back in Rekton.
							</p>

							<p>
								As Kip watched, a sword descended and hacked into the green luxinover his arm. It cut in
								two finger’s breadths, but the luxin was thicker. Itstopped, quivering like an ax in
								wood. Kip flipped over, pulling in moregreen from every light surface, not even knowing
								how he did it, pulling andpulling, drafting light from Orholam’s endless tap.
							</p>

							<p>
								It filled him with that same wildness. Wildness chained, hemmed in,trapped. The luxin
								covering him grew thicker. Kip gathered his feet beneathhimself and stood, roaring.
							</p>

							<p>
								He was crazy. He was crazy, and he felt great. He smashed a greenforearm into a
								wide-eyed man holding a sword. It flung the man back. Kippaused for a second, and spikes
								sprouted from his green armor everywhere.He threw his weight back and forth, crashing
								into the crowd like they wererats to smash against cupboard walls.
							</p>

							<p>
								Blood was flying in red ropes. Kip wasn’t human anymore. He was ananimal, unwilling to
								be caged. He was a mad dog. Some dim, thinking partof him thought that he shouldn’t have
								been able to move so well with such aheavy suit on him. He was strong, but not this
								strong.
							</p>

							<p>
								He had no sense of the battle beyond the little circle around him. Eventhat was a
								blur—sharp motions to the left and right, gleams of light offblades and rising muskets
								to be crushed before they could fire. He slashedand hacked and pounded with unreasoning
								fury. He could hold only onethought: I will not be stopped.
							</p>

							<p>
								In moments, or hours, Kip had no notion of time—he saw fear in everyeye. A continual
								flood of men spilled in through the gap, thrust forth hardby the mass of bodies behind
								them, all pushing them forward and into Kip,but his very presence was slowing the flood,
								men pushing back as soon asthey saw him, others leaping to the sides, hoping to avoid
								his fury.
							</p>

							<p>
								Their weakness inflamed him further. Like rats willing to bite in thedarkness but
								scattering in the light, they were cowards. He clubbed them,smashing heads, ripping open
								bellies. He charged the gap where theycouldn’t flee, impaled them, flung gore left and
								right.
							</p>

							<p>
								A thought won through his brain. Among all the shouting and screamsand fear and mist and
								musket fire and clash of arms, someone wasscreaming a word: “Kip! Kip! King Garadul!
								That way!”
							</p>

							<p>
								Kip couldn’t see who was shouting. He stretched, found himself taller,the luxin swirling
								under his feet, boosting him several hand’s breadths.
							</p>

							<p>
								Looking into the city, he saw Karris, skin red and green entwined, holding asword,
								pointing it deeper into the city still.
							</p>

							<p>
								King Garadul was rallying his Mirrormen around him there, pullingthem together after
								they’d been separated coming through the gap. He wasscreaming orders. Seemed furious
								about something. Hadn’t seen Kip.
							</p>

							<p>
								Before he even knew what he was doing, Kip was charging, all his willfocused, intent,
								implacable. This one thing remained: King Garadul had topay for what he’d done. He had
								to die.
							</p>

							<p>
								Chapter 86
							</p>

							<p>
								When Gavin heard the explosion, he knew immediately what it was. Hewas almost back to
								the wall on his way from the docks, where he’d beenusing the first light to help draft
								boats for the refugees. The evacuation wasentirely possible if people would be
								reasonable. Gavin had told the city’selders that nobles could bring three chests,
								armorers and apothecaries couldbring three as well, rich merchants could bring two, and
								everyone elsecould only bring what they could carry.
							</p>

							<p>
								It was a simple rationale, if a hard one. The fleeing Tyreans would needmedicine, and
								they didn’t want to leave any arms that King Garadul coulduse to arm his troops and
								spread his aggression. And though it stuck inGavin’s throat to help the rich more than
								the poor, the rich would bring theirriches out of the city. Those riches, if left, would
								again be used by KingGaradul and would help him kill others. If people did everything
								accordingto orders, there would still be room for everyone to escape who wanted to.
							</p>

							<p>
								Except, of course, everyone cheated. Everyone. Nobles brought sixchests. Rich merchants
								brought five. Others lied and claimed to be armorersor apothecaries who were not.
							</p>

							<p>
								Gavin put a local guild head in charge, went to draft on the barges, andwhen he came
								back found the man letting his own guild members bringextra baggage. Gavin drafted a
								scaffold off the side of the pier in fiveseconds, and had the man strangling on it in
								ten. He put someone else incharge before the first man was dead.“Make decisions fast and
								as justly as you can,” Gavin told the deeplyfrowning, pockmarked cooper he was putting
								in charge. “And my wholeauthority is behind you, even if you make mistakes. Take one
								bribe, and I’lltake my time making your death as much worse than this as I can
								imagine.”Then he left. He didn’t have time for this.
							</p>

							<p>
								He was at the base of the wall when he heard the explosion. It wasexactly what he’d been
								afraid of. It had been why he’d drafted BrightwaterWall in the first place. With all the
								homes and shops built directly againstthe city wall, it was hard to defend from enemies
								outside, but impossible todefend from enemies within. Anyone who owned a shop could be
								givenbarrels of black powder, tunnel under the wall a little bit, and set a charge.They
								could work in full privacy, uninterrupted—could, and had.

							<p>
								Blackguards in tow, Gavin dug his heels into his horse’s flanks. But hedidn’t head for
								the gap. A hole in the wall was a prize, of course, but itwould immediately attract
								defenders, and it might not be big enough for thearmy to come through. It might become a
								choke point, a killing zone. Betterto use the distraction of a breach in the walls to
								open a gate elsewhere.
							</p>

							<p>
								Gavin dispatched messengers to the Hag’s Gate and the Lover’s Gateand headed toward the
								Mother’s Gate. At the top of the wall, he ran intoGeneral Corvan Danavis with his
								entourage. Doubtless, Corvan was goingto direct the defense at the breach in the wall
								personally.
							</p>

							<p>
								Corvan paused only to say, “They’re holding back their drafters andcolor wights. I don’t
								know why. But if we lose a gate in the next twentyminutes, we won’t make it until noon.”
								That was Corvan, condensing theinformation to the absolutely vital.“If it falls,” Gavin
								said, “be at the ships an hour before noon.”Corvan nodded his head. No fighting to the
								death. Gavin clapped
							</p>

							<p>
								Corvan’s shoulder. Then the general was gone.
							</p>

							<p>
								At the top of the gate, Gavin looked over the teeming mass on the otherside. Hardly
								anyone was firing at the invaders from the wall anymore, butthe army pushed forward like
								a blind beast, black fingertips reaching up tograb the wall.
							</p>

							<p>
								Many of the homes outside the wall had been demolished in just a fewhours, but of those
								that remained, the army had found which places wereeasiest to scale. At half a dozen
								places, a slow trickle of men wereclambering up onto the wall itself and engaging the
								few defenders.
							</p>

							<p>
								Farther out, King Garadul’s men were setting up their mortars. Too late,really. There
								was no point in them bombarding the city at all, and doing sonow would probably kill as
								many of their own as it would kill defenders.Nonetheless, they were already loading the
								mortars. Gavin had found thatlots of men liked to be safe from the fighting, but they
								wanted to be able tosay they’d taken part. Those idiots would fire some rounds and later
								braghow they’d turned the battle.
							</p>

							<p>
								Good to see that King Garadul’s got discipline problems too.And where was the king?From
								the gate’s highest point, looking back into the city, Gavin spiedhim despite the mists.
								King Garadul had pressed into the city himself. Idiot!Sure, Gavin had done the same more
								than once, but he was armed like fewothers. Gavin’s presence on a battlefield wasn’t
								simple morale-boosting.King Garadul was leading the attack, surrounded by perhaps a
								hundredMirrormen. As Gavin caught sight of him, he saw the king yelling at
								somemessenger, gesticulating angrily.
							</p>

							<p>
								He wants his drafters.And why isn’t he getting them?Gavin moved to the front of the
								Mother’s spear, stared out to the hill,some five hundred paces away. On the crown of the
								hill there were bannersand a crowd. He drafted lenses, adjusted the distance necessary
								between thetwo to get the focus right, and studied the image above the low-hangingmists.
								A multicolored man was lifting a musket, pointing it right at him.Insanity. No musket
								could fire so—
							</p>

							<p>
								The musket fired—a huge charge from the cloud of black smoke. Gavincouldn’t hear it over
								the rest of the sounds of battle, of course. One of themortars fired. Gavin continued to
								study the man. He drafted the two lensestogether to keep the focus steady. A polychrome
								wight. Probably a fullpolychrome, or at least pretending to be one, from all the colors
								he’ddrafted into his own body. Curious. The man was studying him too.
							</p>

							<p>
								Around Lord Omnichrome, there were not just the usual complement ofgenerals and lackeys,
								but dozens of drafters. They were clearly not goinganywhere.
							</p>

							<p>
								Someone handed the musket back to Lord Omnichrome. Lord
							</p>

							<p>
								Omnichrome took the musket, aimed quickly, and fired. A second later,something hit the
								Mother’s spear two paces above Gavin’s head andexploded, taking a chunk out of the rock.
								Luxin projectiles? From fivehundred paces? Gavin was still thinking about it as the
								Blackguards pulledhim away and to the back of the spear.
							</p>

							<p>
								Lord Omnichrome wanted King Garadul dead. So simple, so bold. Heprobably had even egged
								on King Garadul at Brightwater Wall, daring himto be a promachos, getting the young king
								to lead from the front, hopinghe’d get killed.
							</p>

							<p>
								If your enemy wants it, deny it.Gavin drafted a small yellow tablet, making it read,
								“Capture Garadul,not kill. At all costs.” He covered it in blue and liquid yellow luxin
								and shotit into the path where he believed Corvan was going.
							</p>

							<p>
								But Gavin’s intuition told him the main strike was going to happenelsewhere, while the
								defenders focused their efforts here. “To the Hag’sGate,” he told his Blackguards. “We
								run!”
							</p>

							<p>
								Chapter 87
							</p>

							<p>
								Karris snatched a second sword from a man lying on the ground, bleedingfrom a stomach
								wound. She didn’t know what side he was fighting for; shedidn’t care. The city smelled
								of gunpowder, sewage, and men’s sweat, thekind of stench that gets into leather armor
								and never comes out. As she ran,she drafted a thin sheen of green luxin down the swords,
								sealed it, then ranred luxin on top of that and sealed that too.
							</p>

							<p>
								This entire area was a tangle of alleys. The buildings were thrown downhaphazardly with
								seeming intent to vex one’s neighbors and make straightlines of sight impossible. The
								good news was that it made it impossible forKing Garadul to rally his men in any numbers
								here.
							</p>

							<p>
								The bad news was that—oh shit! Karris rounded a corner and almost raninto three
								Mirrormen, lost, peering down different alleys and looking likethey were about to start
								arguing which way to go. Karris careened into thembefore any of them could react. She
								threw her weight into the smallest oneand, catching him flat-footed, managed both to
								stop herself and to fling himoff his feet. She spun, left sword swinging in a red arc.
							</p>

							<p>
								The second Mirrorman was moving his sword into guard position, buttoo slowly, with no
								leverage. Her blade beat right through his and cut intohis neck above his gorget. Not a
								deep cut, but deep enough, right there. Redluxin splattered on the outside of his armor,
								and as she yanked the bladeback, red blood splattered the inside to match. He was still
								standing for themoment, but to Karris he was already dead.
							</p>

							<p>
								Between colliding with the first Mirrorman and cutting the second,
							</p>

							<p>
								Karris had lost sight of the last one. She spun around, ducking, blockingwith both
								swords, left down, right up in a reversed grip. The cut would havebeaten right through
								her weak right-hand guard if she hadn’t ducked too.Instead, her own blade slapped into
								her shoulder. She couldn’t tell if it cut—what kind of moron went into battle without
								armor?
							</p>

							<p>
								She came up cutting, but the Mirrorman blocked her strike. Then hiseyes went wide. A low
								red flush of light washed them both. His sword hadstruck sparks off of hers, setting the
								red luxin aflame—and not only on hersword. Where the two blades had met, his sword had
								scraped off red luxintoo, and the same sparks had set his alight. She’d intended the
								flames forlater, but it worked as well for now.
							</p>

							<p>
								Karris swung her right-hand, flaming sword in a quick arc and stabbedthe Mirrorman in
								the face with her left.
							</p>

							<p>
								If you’re going to wear heavy armor, never open the visor while you’rein battle.
							</p>

							<p>
								She kicked him off her blade in a spray of broken teeth and exhaledblood, spun again,
								and saw the Mirrorman she’d collided with and sentsprawling crawling for his blade. She
								stomped on his hand as he lunged forit, and punched her blade through the mirror armor.
								It took a strong, directstrike to push through plate, but she’d practiced it a hundred
								times with theBlackguard, who trained assuming assassins would bear every
								advantage,including mirror armor.
							</p>

							<p>
								Pulling the blade free again, she quickly wiped the last of the flamingred luxin off the
								sword with one of the men’s cloaks and reapplied the redluxin. She’d set herself alight
								if she wasn’t careful. She lifted a sturdy bowand a half-empty quiver from one of the
								dead.
							</p>

							<p>
								Now where the hell was she? And where was Kip?Karris had taken a shortcut, she thought.
								She knew there was a marketon the south side of the city, and she’d thought she
								remembered roughlywhere it was. She’d pointed Kip after King Garadul hoping he would
								wreaksome havoc by following, which would allow her to circle behind the kingand kill
								him.
							</p>

							<p>
								Maybe it had been a bad choice. Orholam, she’d abandoned Kip. A babydrafter.
							</p>

							<p>
								Not that she could have done much to help him. At the Chromeria, theycalled what Kip had
								done going green golem. At one time, they had taughtit as a war magic. No longer.
							</p>

							<p>
								There were three problems with going green golem. First, you couldn’tseal the green
								luxin. If you did, you couldn’t move. Some drafters gotaround that by making big sealed
								plates and just holding the joints in opengreen. What Kip was doing was much harder. He
								was holding all the magicat once. It took enormous focus, and the armor was only as hard
								as his will.If someone broke his focus, he’d lose his armor instantly. Second, using
								thatmuch green luxin burned out drafters fast. In the False Prism’s War, Karrishad heard
								of green drafters breaking the halo after going green golem onlythree or four times.
								Third, you had to be strong as a bull. The suit—thearmor, the golem, whatever it was—had
								weight. For the drafter, it was lessbecause their will took part of the weight, but they
								still had to move anenormous hunk of luxin. That said, using open green in the legs did
								meanthat a skilled user could make enormous bounds, and once they got moving,they were
								nearly impossible to stop.
							</p>

							<p>
								It all meant that Kip was more likely to get himself killed than anything.
							</p>

							<p>
								And Karris had abandoned him. Damn it. What kind of woman abandons achild?
							</p>

							<p>
								Karris double-checked the position of the sun from the shadows. Thesun was still low in
								the sky and these alleys were swaddled in shadows andmist. As she looked up, she was
								struck by it. The rooftops rose from themists like distant, square mountain peaks
								reigning over the clouds. Then shesaw the retreat flares. It was the color Gavin or the
								Blackguards weresupposed to use, and she was sure that was how he was using them now.But
								retreat to where?
							</p>

							<p>
								The docks. They knew they were going to lose the city. They were justtrying to make King
								Garadul pay as heavy a price as possible. Karris didn’thave much time to make sure that
								price was the ultimate price.
							</p>

							<p>
								She ran into an empty house—she was pretty sure all the houses wereempty here. Pushing
								past the leavings of chickens and several dogs, and onelive skinny cow—lots of people
								brought their animals inside during thenight, both for safety and to warm the house—she
								found the stairs, ran up tothe family’s quarters, which had been hurriedly emptied, and
								found theladder to the roof.
							</p>

							<p>
								The square, squat houses of Garriston all had these flat roofs. The roofbecame a third
								room for most families. A perfect place to cool down on thehot, long summer evenings,
								the commoners’ only chance of catching abreeze off the Cerulean Sea. The buildings were
								packed tight, but by nomeans uniform. Not every building was three stories, and even of
								the manythat were, the stories were different heights.
							</p>

							<p>
								All the same, as Karris reached the roof, for one moment she was struckby the beauty of
								the scene. The whitewashed roofs, little squares andrectangles, gleaming in the sun,
								with mist curling up around every edge,churches and a few mansions rising like mountains
								out of the clouds, andthe Travertine Palace dominating everything. Farther south, she
								could justsee Brightwater Wall, like a golden belt around the city. Nearer, there
								wasblack smoking rising from the city wall, flashes of magic from the gates.
							</p>

							<p>
								She shut it out. Found the market she’d been heading for. With the mist,she couldn’t see
								enough to tell if her guess had been correct.
							</p>

							<p>
								You’ve already bet Kip’s life on this course, might as well see if it paysoff.
							</p>

							<p>
								Cursing herself for a fool, Karris drafted a green weapon harness,sheathed both blades
								on her back, messed with the harness for a second toget it to set right with the quiver
								and bow, cursed the torn, tight sleeves onher dress, cursed her muscular shoulders, and
								tore the sleeves off. Shebreathed. Then she sprinted to the edge of the roof and leapt.
							</p>

							<p>
								The houses here were so close, it was an easy jump. Some homes evenhad planks between
								them so neighbors could visit each other. So long as shedidn’t want to cross the street,
								it was easy going. She ran as fast as shecould. One street to clear, then another block
								of houses, then the market.Her eyes bounced back and forth as she approached the larger
								gap ofcrossing the street.
							</p>

							<p>
								There! One of the houses on the other side had a significantly lowerroof. Karris veered
								left and leapt, passing over the heads of thirty or fortyMirrormen. She hit the lower
								roof, rolled, popped to her feet just in time tohave to leap again—to a higher roof. She
								hit the next roof with one footextended. She pushed up, trying to push herself just a
								little higher but notstop her forward momentum.
							</p>

							<p>
								Her body popped up, but not forward enough. She landed with half ofher torso on flat,
								whitewashed stucco, then slid down, scrambling, trying tofind purchase.
							</p>

							<p>
								She dropped to her fingertips, on dirty, cracked, crumbling stucco. Sheswung sideways,
								lost one handhold for a second as the stucco ripped away.She latched her hand back onto
								the roof, a clean grip this time, and swungback the other way. Her foot reached the
								edge, tearing the slit of her dressup even higher. She pulled herself up quickly, not
								trusting that the rest ofthe stucco wouldn’t crumble at any moment.
							</p>

							<p>
								No time to be elated at being alive. Karris checked her swords and bow,glanced once down
								at the twenty-foot drop onto an uneven surface below—a broken leg there if she’d fallen,
								at least. Then she ran again.
							</p>

							<p>
								She reached a roof overlooking the market and stopped. King Garadulwas coming, with
								hundreds of Mirrormen and a few drafters—and Kip washot on their heels. Literally.
							</p>

							<p>
								This was going to get messy.Karris smiled.
							</p>

							<p>
								Chapter 88
							</p>

							<p>
								Kip was on fire. Someone had doused him in red luxin and lit him up.
							</p>

							<p>
								It didn’t stop him. He simply thickened the green that encased him sothe red wouldn’t
								burn through. The pyre jelly stuck to the green. Hecouldn’t rub it away from his face,
								it was glued in place, implacable. But hecould move the green luxin itself, so he made
								it swirl outward, until hiseyes were clear and he could see again. Using the same
								technique, heswirled all of the pyre jelly to his arms and shoulders, then along his
								sides,so he was outlined in flame. It all took only a few moments. He thought it,and the
								luxin did it. Or more precisely, he willed it, and it happened.
							</p>

							<p>
								The wildness within him was so strong that he wanted to break free ofthe city and run
								away. But he wouldn’t allow it. He harnessed the wildness.The wildness would serve him.
								It would help him destroy the man who heldthe lash and the leash, the man who wanted to
								control him: King Garadul.
							</p>

							<p>
								He wasn’t sure that he was going the right way, but he followed the flowof King
								Garadul’s soldiers. Kip himself was like a beacon, burning as hewas in the misty
								morning. But the light made his vision lousy. It was likeholding a torch: if you held it
								over your head, you might see into thedarkness, but if you held it between yourself and
								the darkness, you weren’tgoing to see anything at all. Kip was the torch. He couldn’t
								see much, andhe didn’t care. He could see the men streaming away from him, some ofthem
								seeing him and just running like hell, but others seemed to be runningtoward something.
								A meeting place, a rallying point. Where King Garadulwould be.
							</p>

							<p>
								Kip barreled around a corner into the backs of half a dozen soldiers.
							</p>

							<p>
								They hadn’t seen him and he couldn’t stop. He ran right over them in amess of screams
								and burning flesh and curses and blood and a struggle justto keep from falling as he
								stepped on body parts. He swung his arms in bigsweeping motions, fire and blood and
								blades unleashed into a crowd.
							</p>

							<p>
								And it was a crowd. Kip had made it. There were hundreds of soldiershere. He could see
								dim flashes of the winking armor of the Mirrormen onthe other side of the square. Then
								he was subsumed, folded into the lovingarms of battle. There was no morning mist. No
								counting of his foes. Nodeciphering the shouts of his enemies into plain language,
								orders that mighthelp him know what was coming. There was only the roar coming fromKip’s
								own throat, the hammering of his own heart, the pulsing life that washis magic. There
								was only the burning in his muscles, the resistance his armfelt as a bladed arm cut into
								a man’s torso, and the freedom as he pulled itall the way through.
							</p>

							<p>
								The world closed in on Kip. He could barely see, barely turn his neckwithin the green
								armor. It drove him crazy. He needed freedom. He couldn’tbe trapped. He was an animal.
								He crashed through ranks of soldiers as theyformed against him. His sweeping arms
								snapped spears like nothing. Hebludgeoned heads with his closed fists. Tore men off his
								back and snappedtheir spines in his hands.
							</p>

							<p>
								Then, abruptly, the ranks parted in front of him. All except one man,who didn’t move
								aside in time, and Kip saw two rows of ten musketeerseach. The first row was kneeling,
								the second row standing, all musketspointed at him. Someone shouted, his voice a
								command. And Kip saw theone soldier between him and the musketeers. The man heard too,
								andunderstood. Kip saw the panic on his face.
							</p>

							<p>
								The musketeers loosed a volley. Fire and smoke leaped like a pouncing,snarling lion from
								their muskets. Kip saw the soldier cut down, even as hesteeled himself against the
								blast.
							</p>

							<p>
								The musket balls hit him like a fist, many striking at the same time, anda few instants
								behind the first, carrying him like a punch’s follow-through.He was swept off his feet.
							</p>

							<p>
								A cheer went up. Kip’s head swam and he felt the green luxin going softall around him.
							</p>

							<p>
								No! I can take punishment. That’s my gift. That’s my talent.A musketeer ran over to Kip,
								pointed a blunderbuss at his head.
							</p>

							<p>
								Something streaked by the man’s head—an arrow?—but missed. Kipgrabbed the yawning mouth
								of the blunderbuss and pulled it to himself,stuck it right to his forehead, and pressed
								green luxin down the barrel. Theman pulled the trigger and the breech exploded.
							</p>

							<p>
								Kip jumped to his feet with inhuman strength. He stomped on thescreaming musketeer and
								looked at himself. He could see the lead musketballs, flattened, inside his green armor.
								Like they’d shot a tree. The bulletshad penetrated, but been stopped. Kip laughed, damn
								near insane. He wasbulletproof.
							</p>

							<p>
								Ignoring the musketeers, several of whom were running away while therest were reloading
								furiously, fumbling with their ramrods and powderhorns, trying to ready another shot,
								Kip looked for King Garadul. Thesemen were no threat. They couldn’t bind him. But he
								couldn’t see. So hepulled green luxin around him and made himself taller. Simple.
							</p>

							<p>
								And there he was. Surrounded by his Mirrormen, King Garadul wasmounted, shouting at a
								drafter beside him, pointing at Kip. The drafter’sskin was bright blue, but even as she
								gathered her magic, somethingstreaked out of the sky. The woman’s hands opened limply
								and blue pouredout of her, puddled on the ground. She toppled out of her saddle.
							</p>

							<p>
								King Garadul stopped in midsentence, looked around. The drafter on hisother side, a red,
								fell out of her saddle. This time Kip—and all theMirrormen—followed the arrow’s path
								back to its source. Up on a rooftop.Karris, skinny, muscular, bloody, wearing a torn
								dress and already drawinganother arrow. One of the Mirrormen tackled King Garadul out of
								hissaddle. Karris’s third arrow cracked a Mirrorman’s greave and pinned hisleg into his
								horse. The stallion went crazy, bolting, knocking down half adozen men and trampling
								them before it tripped and rolled over on theMirrorman.
							</p>

							<p>
								Kip ignored the havoc. He had his target now. He could feel his strengthebbing. He had
								to do this now. There would be no second chance. He bulledforward, men and women dodging
								out of his way, slowly reaching fullspeed.
							</p>

							<p>
								I’m crazy.Kip laughed. If this was insanity, so be it. He collided with the firstranks
								of Mirrormen before they had all recovered from looking for Karris.Some were turned,
								some were mounted, others had dismounted, some werestill drawing or reloading muskets to
								fire at the rooftop assassin. Kipbowled over a horse, smashed men, deflected weak
								strikes.
							</p>

							<p>
								Swinging one big luxin fist, he crushed a Mirrorman’s helmet, but theblow also sheared
								off half of Kip’s green hand. Elsewhere, he saw that thespikes and blades he’d drafted
								onto his body had been cut or broken offwhere it collided with mirror armor. He smashed
								left and right, but even ashe crushed men, his armor was disintegrating. He was hacking
								parts ofhimself off with every blow he inflicted.
							</p>

							<p>
								The Mirrormen, recovering, formed up behind the front row. Kip burstthrough the row and
								found himself staring at dozens of pistols, all roaring.It knocked him back once more,
								even though he braced himself. He felt hotlines against his skin—the luxin was thinner
								now. Some of the shots musthave gotten through.
							</p>

							<p>
								I will not fail. Not now. Not so close. Damn it, where’s the king?Kip lashed out at the
								nearest Mirrorman, shooting a ball of green luxinat the man. It hit the Mirrorman’s
								chest and split in half, gobs of green luxinflying off in either direction, leaving no
								more damage than if Kip hadthumped the man’s chest lightly with his fist, scored only
								because a musketball had been carried unintentionally inside the green luxin Kip had
								thrown.
							</p>

							<p>
								The rest of the Mirrormen dropped their muskets and drew sharp,mirror-bright swords as
								one. Kip was looking at his chest, studded withthose flattened musket balls suspended in
								green luxin, some of themsurrounded by blood where they had cut him. He was drawing in
								moreluxin to replenish his armor and he saw the little balls swirling around likelittle
								boats under a waterfall.
							</p>

							<p>
								Luxin doesn’t hurt? How about lead?Kip drew one of the lead balls up from his chest into
								his hand. Heextended his hand and shot out a tiny ball of green luxin carrying themusket
								ball with all his will.
							</p>

							<p>
								A little hole lined in green goo appeared in one of the Mirrormen’s chestplates. His
								mirror armor cracked in splintery, spidery lines around the hole,and then crimson blood
								joined the emerald luxin and he toppled backward.
							</p>

							<p>
								It was like Orholam had breathed new life into Kip. He was exhausted,broken, elated, and
								free. He was laughing again. Totally insane. Totallyunstoppable. Lead bullets swirled
								through his armor and into his palms andhe fired them like he was a musket himself. The
								weight of green armor,which had been so crippling before, now allowed him to shoot the
								littlebullets so hard that if he had been doing it without the armor it would havebowled
								him over.
							</p>

							<p>
								He extended right hand, left hand, right hand, left. Shooting everywhere.
							</p>

							<p>
								At each place, men died. Kip wasn’t accurate in the least, but this close, hedidn’t need
								accuracy. He pointed at a chest and might hit a neck or a bellyor someone else in the
								second rank. Either way, it killed, and ranksdisappeared before him. He emptied all the
								musket balls from his chest andfound more in his back and arms, and new ones added every
								moment. Hecut a gory path through the Mirrormen. He couldn’t see King Garadul, buthe
								figured that wherever the resistance was greatest was probably the rightway. Nothing
								good is easy.
							</p>

							<p>
								Through the ranks and chaos, Kip saw a flash of something. Royalgarments. Garadul.
							</p>

							<p>
								He burst through just as King Garadul was pulled up onto a platform atthe back of the
								market square. His men were trying to hustle him downsome narrow alley there. Kip
								bounded forward, and found that his greenluxin legs bounced him much farther than he’d
								intended. He landedbetween King Garadul and the alley, crushing two of the king’s
								men,including his last drafter. The ground was littered with dead drafters, butKip
								didn’t care how they’d died. He had eyes only for the king. Heextended a hand behind him
								and shot out a dozen musket balls toward theremaining Mirrormen.
							</p>

							<p>
								King Garadul tripped over a body on the platform. In an instant, Kipwas on top of him.
								He kicked at Kip. Kip brought a big fist down and brokethe king’s leg like kindling. The
								man screamed. Kip grabbed his head,latching big luxin fists together on either side and
								lifting. The rattle ofmusket fire stopped. Kip was too close to the king; no one would
								dare.“You killed my mother!” Kip shouted in the king’s face.The king’s eyes focused on
								Kip’s face within the green armor. “You?”he said. “Lina’s brat? She’s not worthy of
								vengeance and you know it.”“Kip!” Someone was shouting, but Kip barely heard it. The
								king wastrying to draw a bich’hwa from his belt, but he was in too much pain.“Go to
								hell!” Kip screamed. “You go to hell!” He lifted the king highand squeezed with all his
								strength and all his will.“Kip! Stop! This is just what Lord Omnichrome wants—”Nothing
								could penetrate the madness, the sheer fury. Kip wasn’t evensure whether it was more at
								this man for massacring his village or at hismother. He loved her. He hated her.
							</p>

							<p>
								King Garadul screamed and Kip screamed and together they drownedout Corvan Danavis’s
								scream. Kip’s hands clapped together and the king’shead popped like a grape, like a
								watermelon dropped from a great height,splattering juice all over.“Kip! No! It’s just
								what they want you to do!” Corvan Danavis’s voicepenetrated Kip’s iron skull as he
								dropped the king’s limp corpse onto theplatform.
							</p>

							<p>
								Looking up, stunned, Kip saw Corvan Danavis, mounted at the head ofperhaps a hundred men
								riding into the square. The invaders, already brokenand leaderless without King Garadul,
								scattered at the sight of so many freshsoldiers.
							</p>

							<p>
								Kip heard a body fall behind him, and turned to see a Mirrorman with anarrow in his
								heart. Someone had saved him. Again. He hadn’t even seen theman. His brain was swimming.
								He felt like he was shrinking. He wasstanding on his own feet again, the green luxin was
								gone. He tottered, andfelt someone steady him on his feet. He turned. Karris had come
								down fromthe roofs and was taking the bich’hwa from the king’s body. Karris? He’dmeant
								to save her, hadn’t he?
							</p>

							<p>
								That turned out well.He looked at King Garadul’s body and felt nothing but emptiness.
								Whenhe looked up, Corvan Danavis was there, swearing. Kip had never heardMaster Danavis
								swear.“Do you have any idea what you’ve just done?” Corvan asked.“Go to hell,” Kip said,
								empty, dry, lifeless. “He killed our whole town.
							</p>

							<p>
								He deserved worse.”
							</p>

							<p>
								Corvan stopped and looked at Kip with a new respect in his eyes. Hedidn’t say anything
								for a moment, then said, “Mount up. We have to get outof the city. Now.”“But I killed
								him. Don’t we win?” Kip asked. His head felt so thick andfuzzy. And the light was
								hurting his eyes. He wanted nothing so much as ablanket and a dark room. They had won,
								hadn’t they? “Why do we have togo?”“Look at that,” Karris said, coming close. She was
								already mounted. Shewas pointing toward the wall.
							</p>

							<p>
								Lord Omnichrome stood on top of the Mother’s Gate, perhaps fourhundred paces distant,
								and when he spoke, through some trick of magic,they could hear him perfectly. “They’ve
								killed King Garadul! Avenge theking! Drive out the foreigners!”
							</p>

							<p>
								The gate opened, revealing hundreds of drafters—hundreds—anddozens of color wights. They
								were followed by thousands more soldiers.“That’s why,” Karris said.
							</p>

							<p>
								Chapter 89
							</p>

							<p>
								Gavin’s intuition was wrong.
							</p>

							<p>
								On arriving at the Hag’s Gate, he’d become like a man trying to plug aleaky hull with
								his fingers and toes. He could only reach so far. He and theBlackguards had held the
								Hag’s Gate alone, with no other support, againstthousands of soldiers, for ten minutes
								now. At this point he could hold it bysimply standing here behind the bullet shield his
								Blackguards had drafted infront of him.
							</p>

							<p>
								They weren’t fighting him. Everywhere he went, the army facing himwithdrew. If the city
								had only had one gate, that might have been helpful.But with three gates and a crumbling
								three-quarters circle for a wall, it washopeless. No one would face him. They simply
								sent men around the sidesand waited. If he held these men up for long, the armies would
								simply enterthrough the other gates. By this time surely all the gates had fallen.
							</p>

							<p>
								So his enemy was canny. He wasn’t wasting his men throwing themagainst Gavin. Time would
								deliver the victory into his hands, so he waspreserving his strength. No need to rush
								the victory. Send the men aroundGavin and advance everywhere but where Gavin was. Then
								Gavin wouldeither be rendered totally ineffectual, dashing from one place to
								anotherfighting men who melted away, or he would become separated from themain body of
								his army—at which point Lord Omnichrome would throwaway as many lives as he needed to to
								kill him. Or capture him.
							</p>

							<p>
								The campaigner in Gavin was furious. During the war, he would havegone for the throat.
								They wanted to melt in front of him? He would havegone for the king and killed him and
								let the chips fall where they may.Doing such a thing would put him in the most peril
								possible, but hewouldn’t have cared. Which is why fortune favors the young. He snorted.
								Ifhe got killed, the refugees wouldn’t make it two leagues out of the harbor.
							</p>

							<p>
								Cursing, Gavin drafted the retreat flares and shot them high into the sky.“Any news from
								the docks?” he asked.“No, sir.”Gavin hadn’t expected any messengers to be able to find
								him, but it stillwould have been nice. “Let’s go.”
							</p>

							<p>
								A red Blackguard laid down a thick carpet of red luxin across the brokenopening of the
								gate and set fire to it as Gavin turned and started jogging.They’d lost their horses
								earlier, and hadn’t grabbed any replacements.Horses that weren’t trained to musket fire
								and magic were often asdangerous to their riders as they were useful. Being mounted also
								made youa nicer target for muskets and drafters. The city wasn’t that big, they’d run.
							</p>

							<p>
								Odd, running through an empty city. Almost everyone was simply gone,and there wasn’t yet
								that air of abandonment and layer of dust that settledover cities soon after their
								inhabitants had left. Garriston was the kind ofempty that happened when people left food
								burning on the fire and simplyran. The burnt smell hadn’t even dissipated yet. In fact,
								they were lucky noone had burned the city down. Empty alleys. Empty homes. Little
								pottedflowers abandoned in windowsills and not yet withered.
							</p>

							<p>
								Death will come for you too, little flower.They made it to one of the bridges when the
								ambush was sprung. Twodozen drafters and several color wights popped up from the roofs
								and beganhurling magic. No hesitation, no warning. Of course. They’d circled Gavinto cut
								off the most obvious route out. The flat roofs gave them an excellentplatform from which
								to attack, and the open area of the bridge made aperfect killing field.
							</p>

							<p>
								But the Blackguards were Blackguards. Every one of them knew histask and how the tasks
								would shift depending on which of them were killed.They practiced for this. This is what
								they were. Shields of green luxin, blueluxin, and more green luxin, three layers thick,
								enfolded Gavin. He knewexactly where they would land, and each shield had holes in it,
								so that hecould fight too.
							</p>

							<p>
								He stuck a hand outside of his shield and pointed at every one of theattackers he could
								see. He shot narrow tendrils of superviolet luxin at them,sticking it to each drafter,
								leaving dangling ropes of superviolet. Two of theBlackguards were superviolet/blue
								bichromes. Their first action was toshield Gavin, second to shield themselves, and
								third—if possible—this.They could see Gavin’s superviolet threads, and they drafted blue
								alongthose shining paths as they pulled grenadoes from their bandoliers. Theyhurled the
								grenadoes, which followed the arcing superviolet tracksunerringly. One, two, three,
								four, five, six. They had even bolstered the arcsof luxin so they followed a natural
								throwing path.
							</p>

							<p>
								But the ambushers were moving too. Three Blackguards went down inthe first wave of fire
								missiles. In defending Gavin first, they couldn’t fixtheir own shields in time. A gout
								of red luxin jetted in from four sides,trying to drench the entire bridge so they could
								set it alight. Blue and greenBlackguards threw up shields to divert the flows off the
								sides of the bridgewhile a yellow threw light-burst grenadoes at everyone she could see.
							</p>

							<p>
								Gavin looked forward and saw that the ambushers weren’t blocking theway across the
								bridge. There was only one reason for that. They wantedGavin and the Blackguard to flee
								headlong into something worse.
							</p>

							<p>
								Projectiles were sparking and whining off his shields, grenadoes’explosions were rocking
								the rooftops, and huge blue knives like icicleswere being fired by two of the color
								wights behind them. The Blackguardswere compressed tight around Gavin, using their
								shields and, if that failed,their bodies to keep him safe.“Let’s move! Cross the
								bridge!” the commander said. She was young.
							</p>

							<p>
								Orholam, had they lost so many that this young woman was in charge?
							</p>

							<p>
								All this was according to the Blackguard training, too. Protect, secure,decide, act. No
								hesitation.“No!” Gavin shouted. He pointed off the side of the bridge and drafted anew
								walkway in green from the middle span to a point thirty paces down.“Flash!” one of the
								Blackguards yelled. She was a yellow. She launcheda flash bomb a mere ten paces into the
								air. Gavin and the Blackguardscovered their faces as it exploded with so much force that
								Gavin could feelit rock his shields.
							</p>

							<p>
								Then they ran across the new green bridge, even as the bridge behindthem, no longer
								protected from the red luxin streams, went up in flame.
							</p>

							<p>
								One of the blue wights dropped into the street in front of them as theymade it back to
								land, determined to steer them back into the secondaryambush. A dozen Blackguard hands
								went up and the beast was riddled withluxin bullets and cudgeled aside instantly.
							</p>

							<p>
								A Blackguard fell, though Gavin hadn’t seen what cut him down. “No!
							</p>

							<p>
								No! No!” the man was yelling. His partner split away from them. TheBlackguard who had
								fallen rolled over onto his back. His partner, a womannear forty, Laya, Gavin thought
								her name was, stood over him.“I’m sorry,” the fallen Blackguard said. “Too much. Too
								much.”Laya pulled an eyelid up to get a good look at the fallen Blackguard’shalo. She
								whispered something, kissed her fingers, touched them to thefallen man’s eyes, mouth,
								and heart. Then she cut his throat. The rest of theBlackguards didn’t wait.
							</p>

							<p>
								They ran past an alley and found themselves looking at the backs ofdozens of musketeers,
								all in formation, muskets up, pointed the other waywhere the ambush had originally tried
								to steer Gavin. The men were sointent on waiting for their quarry to appear in front of
								them that they didn’tsee Gavin behind them. As they ran past, Laya slopped red luxin
								over them.A lot of red. The whoosh of flame was so intense as she set it alight
								thatGavin saw shadows half a block away—which meant the flames had leaptfor a moment
								above the rooftops. The screams followed. Men burning todeath.
							</p>

							<p>
								One more river crossing. This time, Gavin led the Blackguards to ablank section and
								drafted his own green span across. No need to riskanother ambush.
							</p>

							<p>
								They made it to the docks and found hundreds of soldiers there, musketsloaded, facing
								out. The boats were still being boarded, mountains ofluggage pushed aside, left behind,
								now gathered for use as barriers. Therewas a stream of boats already heading out, a line
								disappearing into thedistance, going through the Guardian’s legs as she stood guard.
								Every shipin the entire harbor had been used. And most were already gone. Two hugebarges
								crafted of blue and green luxin and wood had been constructed andwere already heading
								out too. That left one luxin barge that was rapidlyfilling even now, with far too many
								men to fit in it.
							</p>

							<p>
								The soldiers here were locals mostly—where the hell had all the
							</p>

							<p>
								Ruthgari soldiers gone? Boarded earlier ships no doubt. Someone wouldpay for that, but
								not now. The soldiers who remained looked resolute, andtheir countenances lifted as they
								saw Gavin. These were men who thoughtthey were going to die to give their families a
								chance to get away. Men whowere willing to pay that price.“Who’s in charge?” Gavin
								asked.“I am, sir. Lord Prism. Sir.” A mousy Ruthgari with oddly kinky hair forhis pale
								complexion and a look in his eyes like he was scared to deathstepped forward. In another
								time, Gavin would have laughed to see theawkward little man. “We’ve got almost all the
								ships we have loaded. Mengathered who will fight. We need room for another three
								hundred, if no oneelse comes from the city.”“Any sign of General Danavis or Commander
								Ironfist?” Gavin asked.“No, sir. Lord Prism. Sir.”“Sir is fine,” Gavin said.
								“Blackguards, any of you who can draftwithout breaking the halo, help me. We’ll make one
								more barge while wewait.”“Wait, sir?” a Blackguard asked.“General Danavis is coming. We
								finish one more barge. Then we go.
							</p>

							<p>
								He’ll be here by then.”
							</p>

							<p>
								A trumpet sounded. The pale Ruthgari shouted, “Enemies coming!
							</p>

							<p>
								Ready!”“Can you hold while we make a barge?” Gavin asked.The man was still small, still
								mousy, but his face was resolute, andanything comical about his appearance was gone.
								“We’ll hold, sir. To thelast man.”
							</p>

							<p>
								Chapter 90
							</p>

							<p>
								Karris selected one of the Mirrormen’s horses that looked like it still hadsome wind and
								spirit left. Its barding was mirrored, and it shone in themorning sun. She might as well
								paint a target on her back. Well, she wasn’texactly inconspicuous herself.
							</p>

							<p>
								They didn’t have long. The four hundred paces between Lord
							</p>

							<p>
								Omnichrome’s color wights could only be crossed through a maze of alleysor rubble-strewn
								streets. It would slow them, but not much. Some things,though, had to be done. Karris
								moved to check King Garadul’s body,gritting her teeth against the gore.
							</p>

							<p>
								He was definitely dead. She felt a peculiar emptiness. She’d wanted himdead. He deserved
								it. Now he was just gone. And, quite possibly, it hadn’taccomplished anything. She saw
								her bich’hwa on the ground next to him.Sonuvabitch. She picked it up, and scanned the
								ground, but there was nosight of her ataghan.
							</p>

							<p>
								No more time. Corvan Danavis’s men were finishing collectinggunpowder and shot or
								replacement weapons from the dead and formingback up. Kip looked as bad as Karris would
								have expected. Corvan said,“It’s called being lightsick, Kip, and it might do anything
								to you. Make youfeel weak as a puppy or strong as a sea demon. I’ve seen modest men
								tearoff all their clothes because they couldn’t bear anything touching their skin.And
								shy women, well, never mind.”“Hey, that was just the one time,” Karris protested,
								mounting up. Whenyou could, it was good not to let a drafter sink too deep into
								themselvesafter drafting too much.
							</p>

							<p>
								Corvan laughed. “I don’t know that I’d call you ‘shy,’ on any day, Karris
							</p>

							<p>
								White Oak.” He glanced down at her leg. “Certainly not today.”
							</p>

							<p>
								Karris followed Corvan’s eyes. Oops. She’d managed to tear the slit inher dress
								practically to her hip, and sitting on a horse didn’t help. Well,what was she going to
								do? Go change?“Time’s up!” Corvan shouted to his men. “We head for the docks! Catchup or
								die.” One of his officers came to him with a question, and he wasswallowed up by his
								duties.
							</p>

							<p>
								Which left Karris with Kip. She would prefer to be unencumberedduring a battle, but she
								wasn’t going to abandon him, not again. There werethings more important than her
								freedom. She sidled her horse over to theplatform. “Come here, Kip,” she said with a
								little more edge than shemeant.
							</p>

							<p>
								Obviously dazed, Kip clambered up, and they were off.At first, Karris thought they were
								going to get away cleanly. Then theycame to the bridge. The far end was blocked with
								wagons and carts thatmust have just been set on fire moments before Corvan’s men arrived
								orthey would have seen the smoke.
							</p>

							<p>
								The men at the front of the column skidded to a stop, and the men who’dbeen running
								behind them collided with them, collapsing the column andcausing chaos. Corvan, mounted
								near the front, was trying to extricate somedrafters from the crush to get them to work
								on clearing the flamingbarricades. It would only take a minute or two, in normal
								circumstances.
							</p>

							<p>
								Near to the back of the column, Karris pulled up sharply and startedshouting at the men
								near her to form a rear guard. “Load muskets, affixmatches!” She wheeled around in time
								to see the first of the color wightspursuing them.
							</p>

							<p>
								Karris had never seen anything like it. She’d known green wights couldchange their
								joints to give their legs immense springiness, but the greensweren’t the only color
								wights leaping from roof to roof behind them.
							</p>

							<p>
								A yellow wight, limbs all aglow, ran straight toward the edge of a flatroof, gathering
								luxin in both hands. She leapt off the edge, and threw herhands down, releasing a jet of
								yellow at the ground, using the recoil tothrow her up high enough to make it to the next
								roof. Like she was playingleapfrog in midair.
							</p>

							<p>
								A flash of green, much closer.
							</p>

							<p>
								Karris shot a ball of green up, intercepting the green wight as itdescended. Her shot
								blasted the green wight off its trajectory, lifting it sothat instead of landing among
								the terrified soldiers, it collided with the sideof a building. The soldiers around it
								recovered before the wight did. Karrisheard a rattle of musket fire.
							</p>

							<p>
								Damn! Veterans would have dispatched it with their blades, savingprecious shots for more
								active enemies.
							</p>

							<p>
								Another green wight streaked through the air, and Karris missed it. Itcrashed through
								the back ranks, scattering men. Others, terrified, leveledtheir muskets and fired, most
								of them missing the wight and hitting theirown friends.
							</p>

							<p>
								By the time they put that one down, wights of every color wereconverging on them. Lord
								Omnichrome’s army was rounding a corner, notthree hundred paces away, jogging, picking
								up speed for a charge. Half adozen of Omnichrome’s red and sub-red drafters were
								mounted. Theyclosed within two hundred paces and lobbed great flaming missiles
								towardCorvan’s massed, trapped men.
							</p>

							<p>
								A blue wight, all glittering angles and blades, was the next across therooftops to the
								left. A sub-red was leaping across roofs on the right, bald,her whole body literally
								aflame.
							</p>

							<p>
								Out of nowhere, a big drafter dropped into the street straight in front of
							</p>

							<p>
								Karris, his back to Corvan’s men. He stood, arms spread out as if he wereholding ropes
								and expecting a heavy load. His arms snapped out just as theblue wight and sub-red wight
								leapt to attack.
							</p>

							<p>
								Both color wights jerked hard as the invisible superviolet luxin ropesaround their necks
								went taut. The blue wight’s body went abruptlyhorizontal, all the luxin it had held
								going to jelly in an instant as it lostconcentration. It crashed to the ground in front
								of the rear guard.
							</p>

							<p>
								The sub-red wight, without the benefit of blue armor around her neck,barely changed
								directions. Her body landed on the next roof and fell, andher flaming head rolled right
								into the river.
							</p>

							<p>
								The drafter who’d saved them shot a glance back, making sure the colorwights were dead.
								It took Karris’s breath away. It was Usef Tep, the PurpleBear himself, the hero of the
								False Prism’s War. Even as Karris registeredthe fact, she saw the flaming missiles that
								were arcing toward the rear guardsuddenly veer left and right in the air, exploding at a
								safe distance.
							</p>

							<p>
								Another green wight she hadn’t even seen crashed into the ground,riddled with blue luxin
								knives. Karris saw Eleleph Corzin, skin luminousblue, step out of an alley.“We’ve got
								your backs. Go!” a woman yelled.Karris turned to see at least a dozen drafters stand on
								the last rooftop. Itwas like Karris had stepped into a heroes gallery. The woman who’d
								yelledwas Samila Sayeh. Deedee Falling Leaf stood next to her, skin wrapped invines of
								pure green luxin. Flamehands stood on the corner of the building, asteady stream of
								fireballs popping from each hand. Sisters Tala and Tayri tothe right. Talon Gim bleeding
								heavily, left arm useless, but going to standbeside Usef Tep in the street. And others
								that Karris recognized from heryouth, or who’d fought for Dazen and whom she’d heard
								described in vividdetail.“Damn you! You and that boy are the only ones who can save
								Gavin.
							</p>

							<p>
								Take him and get the hell out of here!” Samila Sayeh yelled, her eyesflashing.
							</p>

							<p>
								Corvan’s men surged as the barricades gave way. Karris felt Kip stirringbehind her. Lord
								Omnichrome’s army was like an onrushing tide. Karrisspurred her horse on, only shooting
								glances back at the magicalconflagration behind her.
							</p>

							<p>
								It was enough. All of Corvan’s men made it over the bridge. From there,it was a straight
								adrenaline-fueled shot to the docks.
							</p>

							<p>
								Karris made it with the last group. Corvan, up at the front, was movingtoward Gavin down
								on the docks. Gavin was working, drafting barges, itlooked like. Someone alerted Gavin,
								and Karris saw a flash of his crookedsmile toward Corvan.
							</p>

							<p>
								And in that moment, Karris knew. It was like she’d been clubbed. Herthroat tightened.
								The pieces spun together. A thousand pieces from the pastsixteen years, and the last few
								in the past few days: That grin. PattingCorvan’s shoulder on the wall this morning. If
								Karris hadn’t spent morethan a decade in the Blackguard, she wouldn’t have caught it.
								But Gavinand Corvan should hate each other. That could be explained away. Theywere
								professionals, sure. They had reasons to work together, right. Butseamless command and
								instant obedience come only with time and trust.How could these men trust each other?
							</p>

							<p>
								Who comes back from war a better man?
							</p>

							<p>
								Gavin had said, “What’s in that note, it isn’t true. I swear it isn’t true.”
							</p>

							<p>
								Why would Gavin double down on a lie that he knew was going to beexposed minutes later?
							</p>

							<p>
								Because it wasn’t a lie.Oh shit.
							</p>

							<p>
								Chapter 91
							</p>

							<p>
								Shaken from his torpor by Karris dismounting, Kip looked from one side tothe other,
								squinting, head pounding. One moment, he’d been holding on tothe woman, more concerned
								that as he clung to her his arms were touchingher breasts and she was going to think he
								was groping her than worriedabout the exploding guns and coruscating magic.
							</p>

							<p>
								He was, by any rational account, a moron.And then, abruptly, they were at the docks. Kip
								couldn’t follow thingswell. At first the men were challenging Corvan, and then welcoming
								him,and Corvan was giving orders and disappearing into the men, talking withthis person
								and that. Kip felt simultaneously dizzy and as strong as a bear.Karris cursed aloud, but
								he didn’t understand why. She pulled at his arms,still clamped around her waist. He
								released her, and almost fell when sheslipped out of the saddle.“I’ll be back for you in
								a little while.” Karris patted his arm. Suddenly,her face came into tight focus. Like he
								was looking through her, like he wasunderstanding her. She looked… vulnerable.
							</p>

							<p>
								Vulnerable? Karris White Oak? At another time, Kip would havelaughed at the thought. Now
								his focus was too great. Her eyes were tight.Some of that was concern for Kip, but that
								pat of his forearm was a “You’llbe fine in a little while” pat. She wasn’t worried about
								Kip. She wasnervous about something else.
							</p>

							<p>
								Karris turned and Kip saw her square her shoulders. Her shoulders lifted—she was taking
								a deep breath. Then she strode down the dock as if shewere as confident as always in
								between soldiers, drafters, sailors, andscared civilians. Despite the bustle and the
								nerves and the not-so-distantfighting, the crowd parted for this vision of war and
								beauty: knottedmuscles and femininity, the luxin sword on her back still smoking, soot
								onher naked shoulders and cleavage, a clawed bich’hwa in her fist, barefoot,black hair
								windblown, her stride fearless.
							</p>

							<p>
								She stopped behind a copper-haired drafter who was working on a greatbarge. Spoke. The
								man’s head whipped around like it was on a swivel. Notjust any man. The Prism.
							</p>

							<p>
								Gavin swept Karris into a huge hug immediately. Relief.Karris’s body was stiff, her arms
								still at her sides, either shocked orrepulsed, Kip couldn’t tell. Then, slowly, the
								stiffness in her arms andshoulders seemed to melt by degrees. Her arms were moving,
								coming up toGavin’s back to return the embrace.
							</p>

							<p>
								Then Gavin saw Kip. Surprise. He released Karris, said something.Karris’s open hand
								cracked across Gavin’s cheek.Gavin’s hands turned up. What did I say?But Karris was
								storming off, not answering.Gavin looked from her to Kip to the unfinished barge behind
								him.
							</p>

							<p>
								Threw his hands down. Kip could swear he heard the curse all the way fromhere. He wanted
								to shrink into himself. It was like he’d just seen his parentsfighting. All he wanted
								was to be gone.
							</p>

							<p>
								He turned toward the city. His vision was still intensely focusing on onething at a
								time, losing the wholes for the parts. The lightsickness. He knewit was an army there in
								front of him, but he only saw this man checking thefuse on his matchlock; this one with
								half of his mustache burned offfiddling with his musket’s ramrod, spinning it in its
								rest; this man with hisplug bayonet out, using it as a back-scratcher and joking with
								his comradesas if he were totally unafraid, while his tight, dead eyes told otherwise;
								thisman talking nonstop while no one paid him any attention.
							</p>

							<p>
								Kip looked over empty slips at the dock. Not a single ship left. Even thesmallest dory
								was gone. Almost on the dock parallel to theirs, he saw ahuge swarthy man chased down
								and surrounded by a dozen Mirrormen.Something defiant was written in the man’s stance,
								but the Mirrormen hadmuskets on him from every angle.
							</p>

							<p>
								Ironfist.“Have I gone mad or is that Commander Ironfist?” Kip asked.“Sir?” a man
								standing next to Kip’s horse asked.“Move!” Kip shouted. “Move!” With a few curses, the
								men parted forhim.“Kip! What are you doing?” Corvan Danavis shouted. From his angle,he
								couldn’t see Ironfist.
							</p>

							<p>
								Kip barely heard him. He dug his heels into the horse and held on fordear life. Breaking
								free of hundreds of nervous men, the horse ran. Kip wastossed around like a sack of
								pomegranates being crushed to juice and seeds.The horse galloped along the edge of the
								docks, going in the right generaldirection—but it wasn’t slowing down. Kip pulled hard
								on the reins, but thehorse had its bit in its teeth. And it wasn’t letting go.
							</p>

							<p>
								The Mirrormen saw Kip coming and yelled. A few had time to dischargeshots. Kip swore a
								musket ball licked his ear with a hot tongue.
							</p>

							<p>
								I am the stupidest person I have ever met. As the horse streaked toward
							</p>

							<p>
								Ironfist and his captors, still not slowing, Kip kicked his feet free of thestirrups and
								jumped out of the saddle, diving for the Mirrormen.
							</p>

							<p>
								Whatever he’d done before with all the green luxin that had cushionedeverything—this
								time he didn’t do it. He missed the Mirrormen and hit theground hard, flipping over and
								over, smacking his cracked, burned left handhard against something. It felt like fire
								traced through every joint in hishand. He smacked his head, skidded on his back, clothes
								tangling him up,and tried to stand.
							</p>

							<p>
								He was facing the city. There was no one that direction. He turnedtoward Commander
								Ironfist, got his feet tangled, fell. Caught himself withhis left hand. Tears sprang out
								of his eyes unbidden. Agony.“No!” Ironfist screamed.Kip was tottering on one knee,
								dizzy, propped up only by his shriekingleft hand. He wanted to fall on his back, show
								these men he wasn’t a threat,beg them not to hurt him.
							</p>

							<p>
								I spend more time on my back than a rent girl. Enough.One of the men had his bayonet
								fixed. He was stepping toward Kip. Kippushed himself up—off his left hand. The fire of
								pain shot up his arm.
							</p>

							<p>
								Kip just pointed his ruined left hand at the Mirrorman and made that fireshoot back
								down, propping himself up on his good hand. Flame roared outand engulfed the man. He
								baked, his mirror armor useless.
							</p>

							<p>
								Staggering to his feet, Kip threw more and more fire into the guards.
							</p>

							<p>
								And then he found out why Corvan had said he wouldn’t want to draft for amonth when you
								were lightsick. His stomach boiled; he puked.
							</p>

							<p>
								He couldn’t keep his feet. The dizziness and nausea dropped him likehe’d been cut off at
								the knees. His stomach cramped so hard he bent in half,curling into a fetal position,
								still puking, splattering vomit on his own pants.
							</p>

							<p>
								Once again, Kip the Charging White Knight manages to do nothing.He was dead. He knew he
								had to be dead. The men had been charging athim and he’d killed at least one of them.
								They should have killed him bynow.“Let go of the rest of the luxin. It’ll make you sick
								again, but it’s better, Ipromise. Now, boy! I can’t carry you and draft at the same
								time!”“Ironfist?”Kip cracked his eyes open, saw dead men scattered around and
								Ironfiststanding over him, his fists bearing spikes of bloodied blue luxin. Ironfisthad
								cuts and dried blood and powder burns everywhere. He wore bluespectacles close to his
								eyes, the earpieces tied tight around the back of hishead. His ghotra had been knocked
								off his head, and his hair was singed onone side. How had the man gotten away after
								commandeering a cannon?Surely the whole of King Garadul’s army had fallen on him.
							</p>

							<p>
								Nonetheless, here he was. Bruised, exhausted, injured, but not so hurtthat he couldn’t
								save Kip one more time.“Now!” Ironfist demanded. “I’m lightsick myself. I know what
								I’masking!”
							</p>

							<p>
								Kip let go of the rest of the luxin and threw up again, his insidesheaving, all of his
								viscera trying to rush out of his mouth.
							</p>

							<p>
								But then, miraculously, he did feel better. Almost able to stand. Ironfistgrabbed the
								shoulder of his shirt and lifted him bodily to his feet.“Idiot boy, I did all this to
								save you, and you nearly throw it away. Whatthe hell were you thinking?”
							</p>

							<p>
								But Kip was in no state to answer.He was staring at the army, back on the other
								dock.Orholam’s balls.A full-scale battle was being waged just two hundred paces away.
							</p>

							<p>
								Perhaps a hundred soldiers and drafters were holding the dock againstthousands of
								soldiers and dozens of drafters. The confined space was allthat kept Gavin’s men from
								being overwhelmed. The front lines were amess of bayonets and swords, a few spears and
								hoes and scythes and long-handled orange limb shears and magic being thrown and blocked
								each way.Behind the front lines, Gavin and some other drafters were just finishing
								thelast barge, unable to join the fighting because their drafting talents wereneeded for
								shipbuilding.
							</p>

							<p>
								The mass of invaders was pushing Gavin’s men steadily backward, theirsheer weight
								unstoppable. To Kip, it looked like they were already too late.And he was still sick,
								still dizzy, still feeling stronger than ever in his life,torn between wanting to lie
								down and feeling like he needed to go runningor he would burn up.“Follow me,” Ironfist
								said. “Stay as close as you can. It doesn’t float forlong.”
							</p>

							<p>
								With no more explanation—float? what was floating?—Ironfist ranstraight off the side of
								the dock, one hand spraying blue luxin out in a widestream.
							</p>

							<p>
								Kip followed, charging down the slick surface, holding his pants tight inhis left hand
								and praying he didn’t fall. The blue path dove off the end ofthe dock steeply and then
								leveled out at the water, floating on top of thesurface like a very unsteady boat.“Keep
								running!” Ironfist said.In front of them, the defense was crumbling just as the great
								luxin bargepushed off the dock. The last remnants of the defenders were trying to
								fightand retreat at the same time. Some turned and were cut down as they triedto run to
								make the jump to the barge. Others abandoned the idea of makingit to the ship themselves
								and stood their ground.
							</p>

							<p>
								Lord Omichrome’s army, though, was so huge and had so much pent-uppressure that without
								a hundred soldiers pushing it back, it burst down thedock, the men behind shoving the
								men in front of them so hard and sorelentlessly that both defenders and the front lines
								of Lord Omnichrome’smen were pushed straight off the edge of the dock. Dozens, perhaps
								ahundred men and women splashed into the bay.
							</p>

							<p>
								We’re not going to make it. There’s nowhere for us to go!But Ironfist merely turned his
								blue path over the waves out. By
							</p>

							<p>
								Orholam, they were going to run all the way out to the barge?
							</p>

							<p>
								Kip couldn’t make it. He was too dizzy. It was too far.“Faster, Kip! Damn you! Faster!”
								Ironfist shouted.Water jumped up into the air to their right. Kip glanced that way,
								sawnothing, found himself running right along the edge of the blue path, almostfalling
								in the water, and curved back. More water jumped to each side ofthem.
							</p>

							<p>
								They’re shooting at us!Lungs heaving, head swimming, in front of them Kip saw magic
								settingthe air alight between the barge and the dock. Gavin was standing at thestern of
								the boat, throwing out great swathes of flame, darts, light grenadoes—a veritable
								artillery barrage of chromaturgy. A space cleared around himon the barge as everyone
								else shrank back, stunned, awed, afraid of anyonewho could handle so much magic. Gavin
								was fighting all the drafters on thedock—by himself. And winning.
							</p>

							<p>
								That’s my father. I can’t let him down. I’ve screwed up everything else.
							</p>

							<p>
								I’m going to get to that damned boat.“I can’t keep this up,” Ironfist shouted, his voice
								strained. “I’ve got tomake it narrower, Kip, or we won’t make it!”“Do it!” Kip
								yelled.The platform abruptly shrank to barely three hand’s breadths wide. Itsank into
								the water even as Kip ran across it, his feet splashing water.
							</p>

							<p>
								But they had only thirty paces to go. The path started arching up, out ofthe water to
								attach to the side of the barge, out of the way of all the magicgoing back and forth.
							</p>

							<p>
								Kip looked up at Gavin, and saw that someone had stepped into theempty circle behind the
								Prism. Though the boy wore peasant’s garb, Kiprecognized him instantly. Zymun! Zymun had
								snuck onto the barge with therest of the refugees, and he was holding a box. Kip’s box.
								The last thingKip’s mother had ever given him. The only thing she’d ever given him.
							</p>

							<p>
								Gavin was still hurling magic and deflecting magic. Everyone was eitherwatching him or
								had crowded to the side of the barge and was watchingIronfist and Kip come in. Ironfist
								was looking down at the path he wasdrafting, intent on the magic. Kip was the only
								person who saw a gleamingknife come out of that box.
							</p>

							<p>
								Kip’s next step missed the narrow luxin platform. He plunged hard intothe water. Clumsy
								Kip. Stupid Kip. His huge splash would make even moreof a distraction for Zymun to take
								advantage of.
							</p>

							<p>
								Lord Omnichrome had sent Zymun to assassinate Gavin. Kip had seen it—and he’d decided to
								go somewhere else. He’d had a dozen chances to dothe right thing, and he’d missed them
								all. Even five minutes ago, if hehadn’t gone after Ironfist, he would have been on the
								barge. He could havestopped Zymun.
							</p>

							<p>
								Kip wouldn’t fail again. He refused. He threw his hands down, openedhis eyes despite the
								water, and starting sucking in light. It hurt like hell. Hedidn’t care. He sucked it in
								like he was the mouth of one of Gavin’s greatskimmer engines. And threw it down.
							</p>

							<p>
								He shot out of the water. By Orholam’s own hand, or by all the luck thathad gone against
								him for his whole life now finally reversing course, heshot in the right direction. He
								flew onto the barge’s deck, blasting throughhalf a dozen people gathered at the railing
								looking for him—and he kept hisfeet, though he was at a crazy angle and had to run as
								fast as he could just tonot fall down.
							</p>

							<p>
								He burst into the opening around Gavin just as Zymun closed on the
							</p>

							<p>
								Prism. Zymun sank the great white dagger into Gavin’s back an instantbefore Kip collided
								with him, the top of Kip’s head smashing Zymun’snose. His momentum carried them both off
								the opposite side of the barge.
							</p>

							<p>
								They landed with a great splash. Kip got a breath before they went underand immediately
								began tearing at Zymun, punching him, ripping at thedagger in his one hand and the
								sheath in the other. Zymun hadn’t taken abreath. He let both go and flailed, trying to
								get away from Kip with panickymotions. Kip tried to slash the other boy, still
								underwater, and missed.
							</p>

							<p>
								With a gasp, Kip surfaced. Zymun surfaced five paces away, bloodstreaming from his
								broken nose, staining the water.
							</p>

							<p>
								Kip heard screams beyond Zymun. The sharks had come and wereturning the water between
								Zymun and the docks to white froth in the frenzy.“Kip! Grab the rope! Grab the rope!”
								someone shouted. A coil hit thewater close to him.
							</p>

							<p>
								Zymun gave Kip one hateful glance and started swimming for shore. Hewas a good swimmer,
								too. Faster than Kip. It would be madness to go afterhim. And he was bleeding.“Kip!”Kip
								felt the first tremor of lightsickness hitting him. Oh shit.But he’d lost his dagger
								before. It was everything. He wouldn’t lose itagain. Bobbing in the waves, trying to
								ignore at least another score oftriangular fins cutting the water headed for the dock,
								he sheathed the bladeand tucked it inside his pants, and only then did he grab the rope.
							</p>

							<p>
								Good thing there was a loop on the end. Kip managed to pull it over hishead before he
								threw up the first time. There was nothing in his stomach, sohe dry heaved as the barge
								towed him along for a way until the men on deckcould haul him out of the water.“Let go
								of the rest of the luxin, Kip,” someone was saying to him.“I can’t, I can’t.” He knew it
								was going to be bad. He couldn’t take anymore pain. He couldn’t even open his eyes.“Come
								on, Kip, do it for me,” Gavin said gently.Kip let go of the last of the luxin. The last
								thing he was aware of waspain shooting through his head, lances of light blotting out
								darkness, only toleave more behind.
							</p>

							<p>
								Chapter 92
							</p>

							<p>
								The prisoner was full in the fever’s grip. The gash he’d cut across his chestand the
								foul hair he’d packed into the cut had done their work. Death orfreedom. It was time.
							</p>

							<p>
								He tried to stand, but couldn’t. He was shaking too hard. Maybe he’dwaited too long.
								He’d wanted—needed—to wait until the fever was at itshottest in order to have any chance
								at all. If he’d miscalculated, he wouldsimply die, and end all of Dazen’s problems for
								him.
							</p>

							<p>
								That would just be tragic.He propped himself up, found his dirty little hair bowl close
								at hand,tried to inspect it for flaws for the thousandth time. He couldn’t tell. He
								feltlike weeping, the fever throwing his very emotions into disarray.“I’m sorry, Dazen.
								I failed you,” he said aloud. Meaningless words.
							</p>

							<p>
								From nowhere. The part of him that had marinated in blue for so manyyears found that
								curious. Not unexpected, but still strange. Why should hefeel emotions simply because
								his blood was literally hotter than normal?Strange, but inconsequential.
							</p>

							<p>
								He pulled the cut on his chest open, pulled out the chunky, dirty, blood-clotted wad of
								filth, and threw it aside. It didn’t all come out together. Somewas stuck in the wound.
								With a grimy fingernail, he scratched out theremaining filth. It made him gag with pain.
							</p>

							<p>
								Stupidity. He’d used his fingernail? When trying to clean a wound? Heshould have drafted
								tweezers. He wasn’t thinking straight. He blinked, hisbody tottering. No, there was no
								failure. Lesser men might fail. Not him.Not without trying his plan.
							</p>

							<p>
								Gavin scooted over to the shallow bowl he’d scraped with his ownhands over the course of
								sixteen years.
							</p>

							<p>
								Well, some men might have nothing to show for sixteen years of labor.He laughed
								aloud.The dead man in the wall looked concerned. Keep it together, Dazen.
							</p>

							<p>
								Gavin. Whatever. Whoever you are, today you’re a prisoner, today you canbe a free man.
								Or a dead man, which is a freedom of its own, isn’t it?
							</p>

							<p>
								Dazen took his finely woven hair bowl and laid it inside the stone bowlhe’d dug over the
								years. It fit perfectly, as well it might. He’d made it to fit,and checked it a thousand
								times as he crafted it. Sitting right in front of thebowl and its depression, Dazen
								untied his loincloth and shifted awkwardlyuntil he could set it aside.“If only Karris
								could see us now, huh?” the dead man said. “How couldshe choose him over this?”
							</p>

							<p>
								Dazen barely glanced at the dead man, sitting in his shiny blue wall,mocking him, seated
								with legs spread grotesquely in front of a hair bowland a shallow hole. “You can’t
								debase me,” Dazen told the dead man. “I dowhat I must. If that’s depravity, so be it.”
								He licked dry lips. He hadn’t beendrinking water. He needed to be nearly dehydrated for
								this. His tongue feltthick.
							</p>

							<p>
								The dead man said something in response, but Dazen ignored him. For amoment, he forgot
								what was next. He needed to make water. He wanted tolie down. Orholam, he was tired. If
								only he could rest, he’d have thestrength…
							</p>

							<p>
								Slapping! That was what was next. A little more pain, and then freedom,
							</p>

							<p>
								Dazen. A little more. You’re a Guile. You can’t be chained like this. You’rethe Prism.
								You’ve been wronged. The world needs to know yourvengeance.
							</p>

							<p>
								Seated still—there was no reason to move from here, he wouldn’t beable to make it back
								if he moved—he studied every surface of his body thatwas visible.
							</p>

							<p>
								Then he started slapping himself. Everywhere that he would be able tosee. Hard.“This
								strikes you as rational?” the dead man asked. “Maybe sixteenyears in blue hasn’t been
								enough for you.”
							</p>

							<p>
								Gavin—Dazen, damn it—ignored him. He slapped his forearms, hisstomach, his chest
								everywhere except where the cut was—he didn’t want topass out this close to victory—and
								his legs. Every surface of his body thathe could see he slapped until it was
								insensitive, numb to the pain and, moreimportant—red.
							</p>

							<p>
								Gavin was only human. Though he was a superchromat, even he madetiny errors. That was
								Dazen’s bet. That was why Gavin hadn’t let anythingwith color down here. If he’d made
								the blue light perfectly, all in only oneincredibly tight spectrum, there would have
								been only blue light to reflectfrom any item. Gavin wouldn’t have had to worry even if
								his prisoner hadred or green or yellow spectacles. But the tiny flash of green Dazen
								sawevery time he pissed into his bowl before it was leached of color told himthat there
								was some spectrum bleed.
							</p>

							<p>
								Now everything depended on how much and how fast he could draft.Shivering, trembling
								hard from fever and from beating his skin nearlybloody, he pissed. Not straight into the
								depression. Not straight into the hairbowl. If he pissed too hard, he was worried he’d
								break right through the oilthat he’d so painstakingly smeared around the inside of the
								hair bowl. So hepissed into his hand, and let the warm liquid flow gently into the hair
								bowl.
							</p>

							<p>
								You’ve made me an animal, brother.But if animal he was, Dazen was a fox. The dehydration
								had made hisurine as shockingly yellow as his body could produce, and the woven,
								oiledhair bowl held. Dazen’s heart leapt—he wanted to weep—as he saw yellowfor the first
								time in sixteen years. Yellow! There was spectrum bleed! ByOrholam, it was beautiful.
							</p>

							<p>
								He drafted off of it. Just a tiny amount, it was like trying to suck waterthrough a bag,
								even as the bowl slowly drained. He drafted a yellow ball,not even as big as his thumb,
								into the palm of his left hand.
							</p>

							<p>
								It immediately started shimmering into light—but yellow light. For thefirst time, Dazen
								saw his cell in something other than blue light. He saw hisbody in something other than
								blue light. And yellow, being in the middle ofthe spectrum rather than at the opposite
								end, made red a hell of a lot easierto see. And it had spectrum bleed both up and down.
							</p>

							<p>
								And Dazen’s whole body was red from him slapping it.Dazen drafted red hard, as hard as
								he could, even as the little yellowmarble sputtered out and disappeared. It was enough.
								It had to be enough.The skin down to his right arm looked dull in the blue light that
								once againdominated the cell, but he knew it was red.
							</p>

							<p>
								And now the whole reason he’d given himself a fever.
							</p>

							<p>
								Dazen drafted heat from his own body. It was incredibly inefficient. Ithad never worked
								before. He was shaking, the fever was so bad he couldn’tthink. Surely… surely…
							</p>

							<p>
								He drew on his body’s heat, tried to imagine it rising in waves as from adesert. A tiny
								flame, a spark was all he needed. He had as much as he couldget. Like an old man, Dazen
								propped himself up. Magic had weight, andwith as much as he was planning to throw, he
								needed to not fall over assoon as he started. He got up to his knees and grinned at the
								dead man.
							</p>

							<p>
								The dead man grinned back, like he’d been expecting this. Like he’dbeen waiting for it
								for years.
							</p>

							<p>
								Dazen brought his hands together. He threw a tiny starter stream of redout of his right
								hand, directly at the dead man’s face. His left hand let all theheat he’d gathered go at
								once—
							</p>

							<p>
								And made a tiny spark.The spark caught. The red blazed, and suddenly the blue cell
								wasflooded with red light and heat. Dazen drafted more and more and releasedit in a
								hammer blow, straight at the dead man, straight at the weak spot inthe cell wall.
							</p>

							<p>
								The concussion bowled him over despite his attempt to brace himself.
							</p>

							<p>
								He’d thrown his fireball with so much will there’d been no way he couldtake the force in
								his weakened body.
							</p>

							<p>
								He didn’t think he lost consciousness, but when he opened his eyes, theworld was still
								blue. Failure. Dear Orholam, no.
							</p>

							<p>
								Dazen rolled over, expecting to see the dead man leering at him. But thedead man was
								gone. A hole stood in his place. Jagged, broken in the wall,the edges smoldering,
								glowing with sludgy low-burning red luxin. A hole,and a tunnel beyond.
							</p>

							<p>
								He couldn’t stop himself. Dazen started weeping. Freedom. He couldn’tstand, he was too
								weak, but he knew he had to get out. He had to go as faras he could from here before
								Gavin discovered he was gone. So he startedcrawling.
							</p>

							<p>
								As he crossed out of the blue luxin cell, he held his breath, sure therewould be some
								trap, or some alarm. Nothing. He breathed deep, fresh, cleanair filling his lungs with
								strength, and began crawling to freedom.
							</p>

							<p>
								Chapter 93
							</p>

							<p>
								Kip woke in a little blue room. Every surface was blue luxin, even the palletwhere he
								was sleeping, though it had been softened with a heap of blankets.From the faint rocking
								motion, he realized he was on one of the blue barges.
							</p>

							<p>
								And his back hurt like hell. In fact, most of his body hurt. His left handwas bandaged
								heavily and he could feel that a thick poultice had beenspread all over it. His
								shoulders and both arms were bruised everywhere, hefelt like someone had beaten both of
								his legs with a board, his head wasthrobbing, and he was sore pretty much any other
								place on his body hecould think of. He wiggled a pinky toe. Yep, that was sore too.
							</p>

							<p>
								And he was hungry. Unbelievable.You’re on a refugee ship, Kip. There ain’t gonna be any
								food.He tried to go back to sleep. That was the best thing for it. He’d feelbetter when
								he woke up. And they might catch some fish or something bythen. He rolled over, and his
								lower back still hurt. What the—He shifted,and realized he was lying on something.
							</p>

							<p>
								Reaching down to his waistband, his fingers brushed something. Hiseyes shot open. The
								knife. His inheritance. If it didn’t hurt so bad, he wouldhave laughed about it.
								Clearly, he’d been carried in here wrapped inblankets, and left. No one had even
								noticed. In an armada of ships withthousands of refugees and soldiers and maybe a
								hundred boats, with piratesand everything else to worry about, apparently Kip hadn’t
								been the firstthing on Gavin’s mind. Well, what did I expect? They couldn’t strip me
								andget me dry clothes—there are no dry clothes.
							</p>

							<p>
								Kip rolled off the knife and sat up. He groaned. He really was sore. Andhungry. But that
								didn’t matter now.
							</p>

							<p>
								A figure passed the door, and Kip hid the knife by his leg hurriedly.Gavin poked his
								head in. “You’re awake!” he said. “How do you feel?”“Like an elephant sat on me,” Kip
								said.Gavin grinned and came and sat on the edge of Kip’s pallet. “I heard youwere trying
								to be Ironfist for a while out there. He’s pretty steamed. He’ssupposed to be the one
								who saves my life, you know.”“He’s mad?” Kip asked, worried.Gavin sobered. “No, Kip. No
								one’s mad at you. He won’t admit it, buthe’s proud of you.”“He is?”“And I am, too.”“I
								thought I was too late.” Gavin was proud of him? His mind couldn’treally register the
								thought. His mother had always been ashamed of him,and the Prism himself was proud? Kip
								blinked quickly, looked away.“You’re really fine?” Kip asked.
							</p>

							<p>
								Gavin smiled. “Never felt better,” he said. “Oh, did you… did you knowthat boy? The
								assassin?”
							</p>

							<p>
								Kip felt a lump in his throat. “He was one of the drafters who wiped out
							</p>

							<p>
								Rekton. Zymun was his name. He tried to kill me there. Did he get eaten?”Kip remembered
								the boy bleeding profusely, swimming toward all thosesharks.“I don’t know,” Gavin said.
								“My rule is, if you don’t see an enemy deadwith your own eyes, assume they’re still
								alive.” He grinned, almost grimly,at a private thought. “But,” he said, shaking himself
								out of it, “I guess thatexplains this.” He pulled out the rosewood box that had held
								Kip’s dagger.
							</p>

							<p>
								Gavin handed it to Kip. “It’s empty,” he said. “But I thought it lookedlike that box
								your mother tried to give you. Either your Zymun stole it fromKing Garadul, or this is a
								common style. Looks like it held a knife, but Iguess that went into the waves. I’m
								sorry.”
							</p>

							<p>
								Kip wanted to rush to confess, but the knife was his. Gavin might take itaway from him.
								Kip hadn’t even gotten to see it yet, not really.“Anyway,” Gavin said, “you rest up.
								I’ve got work to do. I’ll havesomeone send in some food to you, and we’ll talk later.
								All right?” He gotup, stopped at the door. “Thank you, Kip. You saved my life, son.
								Welldone. I’m proud of you.”
							</p>

							<p>
								Son. Son! There was pride in Gavin’s voice as he said it. Kip had madethe Prism proud.
								It was like light bursting over hills to illuminate places inhis soul that had never
								seen it.
							</p>

							<p>
								The lump in his throat grew huge, his eyes filled with tears. Gavinturned to go. “Wait!
								Father, wait!”
							</p>

							<p>
								Kip froze, as did Gavin, outlined in the door. The last time Kip had usedthe word he was
								being a snot, and things hadn’t gone well.
							</p>

							<p>
								And then it got worse, as Kip suddenly realized Gavin had meant “son”like “young man.”
								Kip wished he could go jump back into the water for thesharks. “I’m so sorry,” he said,
								“I didn’t—”“No!” Gavin cut him off with a hand. “Whatever else you did, youproved
								yourself a Guile today, Kip.”
							</p>

							<p>
								Kip licked his lips. “Did Karris… I saw her hit you. Was that because ofme?”
							</p>

							<p>
								Gavin laughed gently. “Kip, a woman is the mystery you’ll never stopinvestigating.”
							</p>

							<p>
								Kip paused. “Is that a yes?”“Karris hit me because I needed hitting.”That didn’t really
								help.“Get some sleep… son,” Gavin said. He paused, as if he was tasting theword. “We’re
								done with that ‘nephew’ nonsense. The world will knowyou’re my son. And to hell with the
								consequences.” A little reckless grin.And then he was gone.
							</p>

							<p>
								Kip didn’t sleep. He propped his back against one blue wall and pulledout the dagger.
								The blade was a dazzling strange white metal with aspiraling core of black threaded from
								point to hilt. There was littleornamentation except for seven clear, perfect diamonds on
								the hilt. Well, sixdiamonds and maybe a sapphire. Kip didn’t really know his jewels, but
								sixstones were clear as glass but brilliantly refractive. The seventh matched theothers
								in size and clarity, but it glowed a brilliant, magical blue. Kipsheathed the dagger.
							</p>

							<p>
								How did my mother get such a thing? How did she not pawn it for haze?Kip opened the
								rosewood box to put the dagger away, and with hisbandaged left hand he fumbled it,
								dropping it upside down in his lap. Heturned it over and saw that the silk lining was
								loose, not attached to the boxitself but to a frame that filled the box. He pulled on
								the frame, lifting it out.Underneath was a thin compartment that held extra laces that
								matched thecolor of the sheath to tie it to different sizes of belt. It wasn’t a
								secretcompartment, but obviously Zymun hadn’t noticed it, nor had KingGaradul, because
								there was a note there.
							</p>

							<p>
								With trepidation, glancing at the door to make sure no one was passing,
							</p>

							<p>
								Kip read the note, written in his mother’s hard, deliberate strokes: “Kip, goto the
								Chromeria and kill the man who raped me and took away everythingI had. Don’t listen to
								his lies. Swear you won’t fail me. If you ever lovedme, if you’ve ever wanted to do
								anything good in this world, use thisdagger to kill your father. Kill Gavin Guile.”
							</p>

							<p>
								Kip felt locked up, paralyzed. Someone was lying to him, betraying him.
							</p>

							<p>
								Kip felt those deep, sucking pools of rage stirring. It had to be his mother.Addict.
								Whore. Liar. Kip’s mother would lie for haze: she would abandonKip in a closet. Gavin
								had been hard on him, but he’d never lied to him. Henever would. Never. He was Kip’s
								family. The first Kip had ever had.
							</p>

							<p>
								But his mother had kept the dagger, and even the box. She could havesold either for a
								mountain of haze. She would have thought of them everytime the madness of craving had
								been on her. If this was more important toher than haze, why would she lie?
							</p>

							<p>
								Kip shivered, feeling like he was being ripped out of his moorings. Hedidn’t know the
								truth. But he would. He swore it.
							</p>

							<p>
								He folded the note and saw a quick scribble on the back he’d missedbefore, written
								looser and faster than the rest, but undeniably in hismother’s hand: “I love you, Kip. I
								always have.” She’d never said thosewords. Not once. Not in his whole life.
							</p>

							<p>
								He threw the note away like it was a serpent. Pushed his face into theblankets so no one
								could hear. And bawled.
							</p>

							<p>
								Chapter 94
							</p>

							<p>
								Dazen was crawling through darkness. This was death, but life lay beyond,somewhere. The
								floor was sharp, cutting his hands and knees cruelly. He’dsucked up as much red luxin as
								he could before he’d left the blue cell, and ifhe hadn’t been fevered, he would have
								kept a flame alive, but his thoughtswere still sluggish, stupid. All he could do was
								hold on to his anger, and thered had helped him do that at first.
							</p>

							<p>
								I will have my vengeance, he thought, but it was passionless. There wasonly the pain in
								his hands and knees and the crawling. He refused to stop.This tunnel had curved and
								curved again, but it couldn’t go on forever.Soon, he would sleep, and either die or wake
								stronger. Strong enough togather his strength and bring down Gavin. He laughed weakly
								and keptcrawling.
							</p>

							<p>
								Damn this sharp rock. What had his brother done? Carved his prison outof pure hellstone?
							</p>

							<p>
								Son of a bitch, that was exactly what Gavin had done. Spent a fortunesimply to cut Dazen
								up. The hateful bastard. But Dazen wasn’t so easy tostop. He kept crawling. Freedom
								would not be denied him so easily.
							</p>

							<p>
								Still, obsidian was so rare that lining an entire tunnel with the stuffwould have cost
								more than the Guile family made in a year. Why wouldGavin have done such a thing? The
								magic properties of the stuff meant thatwith pure darkness and a direct connection—such
								as through blood or anopen cut—it could drain the luxin out of a drafter. No wonder the
								red luxinwasn’t helping Dazen feel hatred anymore. It had all been drained away.
							</p>

							<p>
								Something niggled at Dazen’s mind. The bends in the tunnel, maybe thatwas it. The
								tunnels had bent so that no blue light would spill from the bluecell into the tunnel.
								Thus the tunnel would be totally dark. So the obsidianwould work.
							</p>

							<p>
								Damn Gavin to the evernight. He’s not stopping me. I don’t care if I’m abloody wreck.
								I’m getting out of here.
							</p>

							<p>
								Part of Dazen was telling him to stop, to think. That blue, rational partof him. But he
								couldn’t stop. If he didn’t keep moving, he’d never getanywhere. He was so sick, so
								fevered that if he stopped he might nevermove again. Gavin wanted to paralyze him.
							</p>

							<p>
								No. No no no. Dazen pushed on. The floor here felt different. Notobsidian. He’d gotten
								past it. He crawled farther. He could swear there wasa glow ahead of him. Dear Orholam,
								there was—
							</p>

							<p>
								The floor dropped out from under him, swinging open on hidden hinges.
							</p>

							<p>
								Dazen tumbled down, rolling over and over, unable to stop himself, down achute that
								snapped shut behind him. He rolled over, bathed in green light.
							</p>

							<p>
								Green?An entire, round chamber, with green walls like trees. A hole up top forwater and
								food and air, and a hole in the bottom for waste. Dazen lookeddesperately at his skin
								for the red luxin. It was gone. All gone, all sucked upby the obsidian tunnel.
							</p>

							<p>
								Dazen started laughing stupidly, desperately, madly. A green prison,after the blue
								prison. He laughed until he was sobbing. There wasn’t oneprison. There weren’t two. He
								knew it now. He had no doubt. There wereseven prisons. One for every color, and in
								sixteen years, he had onlyescaped the first.
							</p>

							<p>
								He laughed and sobbed. In one luminous green wall, the dead manlaughed with him. At him.
							</p>

							<p>
								Chapter 95“Not bad for a defeat,” said Corvan Danavis, coming into Gavin’s cabin.
							</p>

							<p>
								Gavin sat up, blinking the sleep from his eyes. His “quick nap” aftertalking to Kip had
								left him wooly. But he’d drafted so much over the pastweek, it was no wonder he felt
								off. He said, “We lost a city, three-quartersof the Blackguard, and hundreds if not
								thousands of soldiers. My naturalson—whom I just acknowledged—publicly murdered a
								rightful satrap,which will make the other satraps worry I’m trying to rule the world
								again.We have thousands of refugees that we have to put Orholam knows where;there’s some
								pagan army in charge of Garriston; and I’ve built them a damnnear unassailable wall,
								which will now protect my enemies. Oh, and yourdaughter has joined our foes. If that’s
								not bad for a defeat, I’m not reallysure what is.”“Could be worse,” Corvan said.Gavin
								rubbed his cheek where Karris had slapped him. It was worse,
							</p>

							<p>
								Corvan, he wanted to say. He’d been so delighted to see Karris alive thathe’d hugged her
								without thinking. He’d deserved the slap for that alone.But she’d clung to him, for half
								a moment. Maybe she just felt relieved tobe safe, away from King Garadul’s army, but
								he’d hoped it was somethingmore.
							</p>

							<p>
								Then she’d whispered, “I know your big secret, you asshole. Whycouldn’t you be man
								enough to tell me yourself?”
							</p>

							<p>
								Big secret? His heart froze up in his chest. Which big secret?She released him and
								stared into his eyes. Unable to take it, he’d glancedaway—and saw Kip. Kip, whom he’d
								thought was most likely dead. Like amoron, he said, “Kip?”
							</p>

							<p>
								He hadn’t meant Kip was his big secret. That would be stupid. Of courseshe knew about
								Kip. But his brain wasn’t working. Her closeness, thebattle, the effects of his drafting
								so much, and the sudden sense of exposurethrottled his thoughts.
							</p>

							<p>
								She’d slapped him. He’d deserved it.Gavin said to Corvan, “It can always be worse. Is
								the weather holding?”
							</p>

							<p>
								He sat up. If he had to make these barges weather a storm, he was going tohave a lot of
								work to do.“Hold up,” Corvan said. “Your attitude when you go out there matters.”Gavin
								stopped. Corvan had talked to him like this before, but not sincethe war. “What are you
								talking about?”“I mean this Lord Omnichrome doesn’t care about Garriston. The onlything
								Garriston was to him was a chance to take a victory from us, andframe you for murdering
								a satrap so he could mobilize people to fight you.What he wants is to destroy the
								Chromeria. He wants to drive out the beliefin Orholam and set up a new order. And we
								don’t even know what that neworder is yet.”“So let’s rephrase ‘defeat’ as ‘crushing
								defeat,’ huh?” Gavin knew hewas being childish, but Corvan was the only person around
								whom he couldcomplain. It felt good to have his friend back.“We have to get ready for
								war,” Corvan said. “A bigger war than overone little city.”“You think people are going
								to join him?”“In droves,” Corvan said. “My daughter did, and she’s not stupid. So wehave
								to believe he’s charismatic, and we’ve already seen that he’s smartenough to defeat us
								and get all he wants. So we have to look at what wehave, and prepare.”“I’m sorry she
								joined him, Corvan. She seemed like such a sensible girl.
							</p>

							<p>
								I should have watched out for her better while she was—”“She is a sensible girl. I’m not
								worried about her. She’ll come back,”
							</p>

							<p>
								Corvan said. There was an edge on his voice, as well there should be. Hewas trying to
								convince himself too. But Gavin knew not to push it.“So what do we have?” Gavin
								asked.“We have you and me. We got Karris back and Kip back and Ironfistback, when we
								could have easily lost all three. We have the devotion,loyalty, awe, and motivation of
								thirty thousand people who now believe in
							</p>

							<p>
								Gavin Guile to the core of their souls. I call that the start of an army. You’rethe
								Prism. How is some pagan king going to stand up to you?”
							</p>

							<p>
								Gavin laughed, because both of them knew that there were about athousand ways. It was
								also a little scary, how Corvan thought. How he sawthrough things. Gavin would have to
								be careful. There are things you can’ttell even your best friend. Great purposes best
								achieved by misdirection.
							</p>

							<p>
								Pensive, Gavin said, “You know, I came up with a list of things I want toaccomplish
								before I die, and the best thing on that list was to free Garriston.What I let happen
								there after the war was… I don’t know if it’s the worstthing I’ve done, that’s a crowded
								field, but I let what was happening inGarriston keep happening. For sixteen years. With
								all my power, I couldnever get the Spectrum to stop it.”“I knew a man once who had a
								knack of changing the rules when hecouldn’t win. He didn’t give up when others said he’d
								already lost,” Corvansaid. “So… Garriston is a collection of ramshackle buildings
								withindefensible walls.”“So I built new walls, I changed the rules. I tried, Corvan! I
								lost!” Gavingrimaced, light dawning. “Oh, and you’re going to say next, ‘You lost
								acollection of ramshackle buildings.’ And I’m going to say, ‘Yes! We’veestablished
								that.’ And you’re going to point out that when I decided to freeGarriston, I probably
								wasn’t worried about the misery of the buildings, butthe misery of the people.”“And then
								I’ll point out that all those people you wanted to free arehere. And then you’ll admit
								my superior wisdom.”
							</p>

							<p>
								Gavin laughed. In some moments, it was like a day hadn’t passed sincethey’d been
								separated. “Well, we know one of those things isn’t going tohappen.”
							</p>

							<p>
								Corvan grinned. He was right, though. “So,” he said, “go out there andsmile, and pat
								your soldiers on the back, and act like an emperor with agreat purpose before him—a
								promachos who will accomplish that greatpurpose. You have freed these people. You are
								going to protect them, andyou will give them a new home. You will give them justice. And
								they’regoing to help you.”“Sometimes I think you should have been the leader, not me,”
								Gavinsaid.“Me too,” Corvan said. He grinned. “Orholam’s ways are mysterious. Insome
								cases, very mysterious.”“Thanks,” Gavin said. Then they laughed together. It felt good.
								Food fora hungry soul.“By the by, how’s your back? I could’ve sworn that little weasel
								stabbedyou. Kip’s being hailed as a hero for stopping him, you know.”“He got him right
								in the nick of time, I guess,” Gavin said, though hemust have taken a shot in the kidney
								from the boy’s fist as Kip had tackledhim, because he had felt a searing pain. He pulled
								his shirt around andshowed it to Corvan. The shirt was cut over his kidney, but his skin
								wasunbroken. “A near thing,” he said.
							</p>

							<p>
								Corvan whistled. “Orholam’s hand must be on you, my friend.”Gavin grunted. From how his
								head felt, he wished Orholam’s hand werea little gentler. “Well, time to go play
								emperor, then,” he said. Together,they walked to the door of the cabin—and who had
								drafted cabins onto thebarge?
							</p>

							<p>
								Gavin paused. “Corvan, something was bothering me.”“Yes?”“All those years you spent in
								that little town. Seems like an awfulcoincidence that both you and Kip were in the same
								place.”“Not a coincidence,” Corvan said soberly.“You tracked him down. You were looking
								out for him. Watching him.”
							</p>

							<p>
								Gavin didn’t need Corvan to confirm it. He knew. “But you never got veryclose to
								him.”“Tried not to, anyway. He’s a good boy. But he is who he is,” Corvansaid. He meant,
								He is your brother’s son. Corvan looked down at his handsand lowered his voice, so that
								even if someone had been eavesdropping justoutside the room, they couldn’t have made out
								the words. “I knew youmight need me to kill him someday. I didn’t want to make it harder
								than ithad to be.”
							</p>

							<p>
								Neither said anything for a long moment.The Danavis motto was Fealty to One. Corvan
								didn’t believe in
							</p>

							<p>
								Orholam, or the Chromeria, or any creed. He believed in Gavin. Sometimesit was
								frightening to have someone believe in you like that. For a second,Gavin considered
								telling Corvan his seventh and final purpose. Trustinghim. But no. Safer this way. He’d
								tell him when the time came.“Some world,” Corvan said finally.“Some day,” Gavin said,
								looking out on the gray skies. Blah.Corvan grunted. “At least it’s nice out,” he said,
								and went on his way.
							</p>

							<p>
								Sometimes Corvan’s sarcasm was so deadpan.Gavin shrugged and went around patting
								shoulders, checking on thewounded, asking about supplies and their course, mostly being
								seen andbeing seen to care and to be in charge. Karris watched him the whole time,but
								never said a word to him. There was another problem he’d have toaddress.
							</p>

							<p>
								He checked in on Kip. The boy was curled up, asleep. As well he mightbe. Gavin was still
								sorting out the tales. According to the stories, Kip haddrafted green, blue, red, and
								maybe yellow. At fifteen years of age. Gavinhad hoped to buy them both some time by
								falsifying the testing stone; Kip’sroad was going to be hard enough as it was. Too late
								now. Smart, brave, andnow a polychrome, the boy had more than proven himself a
								Guile—Gavinwould have to work twice as hard to keep the truth from him.
							</p>

							<p>
								There was a lot of work to do.Not least of which was facing his father and telling him
								his wife wasdead, that his bastard grandson had killed a satrap, and trying to fend off
								aconversation about marrying some satrap’s daughter in order to patch thingsup—a
								conversation Gavin was going to lose.
							</p>

							<p>
								He went to the side of the barge to draft a scull to head over to the otherbarge. He
								looked around for something blue to draft from. There wasnothing. He looked up. There
								were no clouds. He was on a barge on the seaunder a bright sky. But something was wrong.
							</p>

							<p>
								He tried to draft blue. He was a Prism; he could split white light intoanything.
							</p>

							<p>
								But nothing happened.A bolt of panic flashed through Gavin. He counted off his colors on
								hisfingertips, thumb to forefinger first, down then up. Sub-red, red, orange,yellow,
								green, bl—Nothing. He stared at his offending middle finger as ifthis were its fault.
								There was no blue. He couldn’t draft it. He couldn’t evensee it. It was starting. Not on
								the seventh year. Now. He’d never evenknown how a Prism knew when the end began. Now he
								knew. He waslosing his colors. He didn’t have five years left; it was starting now.
								Gavinwas dying.</p>
